29263008	Investigating the genetic architecture of dementia with Lewy bodies: a two-stage genome-wide association study.	Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of dementia in elderly people but has been overshadowed in the research field, partly because of similarities between dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. So far, to our knowledge, no large-scale genetic study of dementia with Lewy bodies has been done. To better understand the genetic basis of dementia with Lewy bodies, we have done a genome-wide association study with the aim of identifying genetic risk factors for this disorder. In this two-stage genome-wide association study, we collected samples from white participants of European ancestry who had been diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies according to established clinical or pathological criteria. In the discovery stage (with the case cohort recruited from 22 centres in ten countries and the controls derived from two publicly available database of Genotypes and Phenotypes studies [phs000404.v1.p1 and phs000982.v1.p1] in the USA), we performed genotyping and exploited the recently established Haplotype Reference Consortium panel as the basis for imputation. Pathological samples were ascertained following autopsy in each individual brain bank, whereas clinical samples were collected after participant examination. There was no specific timeframe for collection of samples. We did association analyses in all participants with dementia with Lewy bodies, and also only in participants with pathological diagnosis. In the replication stage, we performed genotyping of significant and suggestive results from the discovery stage. Lastly, we did a meta-analysis of both stages under a fixed-effects model and used logistic regression to test for association in each stage. This study included 1743 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (1324 with pathological diagnosis) and 4454 controls (1216 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies vs 3791 controls in the discovery stage; 527 vs 663 in the replication stage). Results confirm previously reported associations: APOE (rs429358; odds ratio [OR] 2·40, 95% CI 2·14-2·70; p=1·05 × 10(-48)), SNCA (rs7681440; OR 0·73, 0·66-0·81; p=6·39 × 10(-10)), an GBA (rs35749011; OR 2·55, 1·88-3·46; p=1·78 × 10(-9)). They also provide some evidence for a novel candidate locus, namely CNTN1 (rs7314908; OR 1·51, 1·27-1·79; p=2·32 × 10(-6)); further replication will be important. Additionally, we estimate the heritable component of dementia with Lewy bodies to be about 36%. Despite the small sample size for a genome-wide association study, and acknowledging the potential biases from ascertaining samples from multiple locations, we present the most comprehensive and well powered genetic study in dementia with Lewy bodies so far. These data show that common genetic variability has a role in the disease. The Alzheimer's Society and the Lewy Body Society.
29364747	Rare and Common Variants Conferring Risk of Tooth Agenesis.	We present association results from a large genome-wide association study of tooth agenesis (TA) as well as selective TA, including 1,944 subjects with congenitally missing teeth, excluding third molars, and 338,554 controls, all of European ancestry. We also tested the association of previously identified risk variants, for timing of tooth eruption and orofacial clefts, with TA. We report associations between TA and 9 novel risk variants. Five of these variants associate with selective TA, including a variant conferring risk of orofacial clefts. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of tooth development and disease. The few variants previously associated with TA were uncovered through candidate gene studies guided by mouse knockouts. Knowing the etiology and clinical features of TA is important for planning oral rehabilitation that often involves an interdisciplinary approach.
29293537	Gene-level association analysis of systemic sclerosis: A comparison of African-Americans and White populations.	Gene-level analysis of ImmunoChip or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data has not been previously reported for systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma). The objective of this study was to analyze genetic susceptibility loci in SSc at the gene level and to determine if the detected associations were shared in African-American and White populations, using data from ImmunoChip and GWAS genotyping studies. The White sample included 1833 cases and 3466 controls (956 cases and 2741 controls from the US and 877 cases and 725 controls from Spain) and the African American sample, 291 cases and 260 controls. In both Whites and African Americans, we performed a gene-level analysis that integrates association statistics in a gene possibly harboring multiple SNPs with weak effect on disease risk, using Versatile Gene-based Association Study (VEGAS) software. The SNP-level analysis was performed using PLINK v.1.07. We identified 4 novel candidate genes (STAT1, FCGR2C, NIPSNAP3B, and SCT) significantly associated and 4 genes (SERBP1, PINX1, TMEM175 and EXOC2) suggestively associated with SSc in the gene level analysis in White patients. As an exploratory analysis we compared the results on Whites with those from African Americans. Of previously established susceptibility genes identified in Whites, only TNFAIP3 was significant at the nominal level (p = 6.13x10-3) in African Americans in the gene-level analysis of the ImmunoChip data. Among the top suggestive novel genes identified in Whites based on the ImmunoChip data, FCGR2C and PINX1 were only nominally significant in African Americans (p = 0.016 and p = 0.028, respectively), while among the top novel genes identified in the gene-level analysis in African Americans, UNC5C (p = 5.57x10-4) and CLEC16A (p = 0.0463) were also nominally significant in Whites. We also present the gene-level analysis of SSc clinical and autoantibody phenotypes among Whites. Our findings need to be validated by independent studies, particularly due to the limited sample size of African Americans.	
29309628	Genome-wide association study of offspring birth weight in 86 577 women identifies five novel loci and highlights maternal genetic effects that are independent of fetal genetics.	Genome-wide association studies of birth weight have focused on fetal genetics, whereas relatively little is known about the role of maternal genetic variation. We aimed to identify maternal genetic variants associated with birth weight that could highlight potentially relevant maternal determinants of fetal growth. We meta-analysed data on up to 8.7 million SNPs in up to 86 577 women of European descent from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium and the UK Biobank. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) and analyses of mother-child pairs to quantify the separate maternal and fetal genetic effects. Maternal SNPs at 10 loci (MTNR1B, HMGA2, SH2B3, KCNAB1, L3MBTL3, GCK, EBF1, TCF7L2, ACTL9, CYP3A7) were associated with offspring birth weight at P < 5 × 10-8. In SEM analyses, at least 7 of the 10 associations were consistent with effects of the maternal genotype acting via the intrauterine environment, rather than via effects of shared alleles with the fetus. Variants, or correlated proxies, at many of the loci had been previously associated with adult traits, including fasting glucose (MTNR1B, GCK and TCF7L2) and sex hormone levels (CYP3A7), and one (EBF1) with gestational duration. The identified associations indicate that genetic effects on maternal glucose, cytochrome P450 activity and gestational duration, and potentially on maternal blood pressure and immune function, are relevant for fetal growth. Further characterization of these associations in mechanistic and causal analyses will enhance understanding of the potentially modifiable maternal determinants of fetal growth, with the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with low and high birth weights.	
29304378	Life-Course Genome-wide Association Study Meta-analysis of Total Body BMD and Assessment of Age-Specific Effects.	Bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by DXA is used to evaluate bone health. In children, total body (TB) measurements are commonly used; in older individuals, BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) is used to diagnose osteoporosis. To date, genetic variants in more than 60 loci have been identified as associated with BMD. To investigate the genetic determinants of TB-BMD variation along the life course and test for age-specific effects, we performed a meta-analysis of 30 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of TB-BMD including 66,628 individuals overall and divided across five age strata, each spanning 15 years. We identified variants associated with TB-BMD at 80 loci, of which 36 have not been previously identified; overall, they explain approximately 10% of the TB-BMD variance when combining all age groups and influence the risk of fracture. Pathway and enrichment analysis of the association signals showed clustering within gene sets implicated in the regulation of cell growth and SMAD proteins, overexpressed in the musculoskeletal system, and enriched in enhancer and promoter regions. These findings reveal TB-BMD as a relevant trait for genetic studies of osteoporosis, enabling the identification of variants and pathways influencing different bone compartments. Only variants in ESR1 and close proximity to RANKL showed a clear effect dependency on age. This most likely indicates that the majority of genetic variants identified influence BMD early in life and that their effect can be captured throughout the life course.	
29290336	Genome-wide Study of Atrial Fibrillation Identifies Seven Risk Loci and Highlights Biological Pathways and Regulatory Elements Involved in Cardiac Development.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia and a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure, and premature death. The pathogenesis of AF remains poorly understood, which contributes to the current lack of highly effective treatments. To understand the genetic variation and biology underlying AF, we undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 6,337 AF individuals and 61,607 AF-free individuals from Norway, including replication in an additional 30,679 AF individuals and 278,895 AF-free individuals. Through genotyping and dense imputation mapping from whole-genome sequencing, we tested almost nine million genetic variants across the genome and identified seven risk loci, including two novel loci. One novel locus (lead single-nucleotide variant [SNV] rs12614435; p = 6.76 × 10(-18)) comprised intronic and several highly correlated missense variants situated in the I-, A-, and M-bands of titin, which is the largest protein in humans and responsible for the passive elasticity of heart and skeletal muscle. The other novel locus (lead SNV rs56202902; p = 1.54 × 10(-11)) covered a large, gene-dense chromosome 1 region that has previously been linked to cardiac conduction. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses suggested that many AF-associated genetic variants act through a mechanism of impaired muscle cell differentiation and tissue formation during fetal heart development.	
29310926	Identification of non-HLA genes associated with development of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes in the prospective TEDDY cohort.	Traditional linkage analysis and genome-wide association studies have identified HLA and a number of non-HLA genes as genetic factors for islet autoimmunity (IA) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the relative risk associated with previously identified non-HLA genes is usually very small as measured in cases/controls from mixed populations. Genetic associations for IA and T1D may be more accurately assessed in prospective cohorts. In this study, 5806 subjects from the TEDDY (The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young) study, an international prospective cohort study, were genotyped for 176,586 SNPs on the ImmunoChip. Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to discover the SNPs associated with the risk for IA, T1D, or both. Three regions were associated with the risk of developing any persistent confirmed islet autoantibody: one known region near SH2B3 (HR = 1.35, p = 3.58 × 10(-7)) with Bonferroni-corrected significance and another known region near PTPN22 (HR = 1.46, p = 2.17 × 10(-6)) and one novel region near PPIL2 (HR = 2.47, p = 9.64 × 10(-7)) with suggestive evidence (p < 10(-5)). Two known regions (PTPN22: p = 2.25 × 10(-6), INS; p = 1.32 × 10(-7)) and one novel region (PXK/PDHB: p = 8.99 × 10(-6)) were associated with the risk for multiple islet autoantibodies. First appearing islet autoantibodies differ with respect to association. Two regions (INS: p = 5.67 × 10(-6) and TTC34/PRDM16: 6.45 × 10(-6)) were associated if the fist appearing autoantibody was IAA and one region (RBFOX1: p = 8.02 × 10(-6)) was associated if the first appearing autoantibody was GADA. The analysis of T1D identified one region already known to be associated with T1D (INS: p = 3.13 × 10(-7)) and three novel regions (RNASET2, PLEKHA1, and PPIL2; 5.42 × 10(-6) > p > 2.31 × 10(-6)). These results suggest that a number of low frequency variants influence the risk of developing IA and/or T1D and these variants can be identified by large prospective cohort studies using a survival analysis approach.	
29325163	Transethnic Evaluation Identifies Low-Frequency Loci Associated With 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations.	Vitamin D inadequacy is common in the adult population of the United States. Although the genetic determinants underlying vitamin D inadequacy have been studied in people of European ancestry, less is known about populations with Hispanic or African ancestry. The Trans-Ethnic Evaluation of Vitamin D (TRANSCEN-D) genomewide association study (GWAS) consortium was assembled to replicate genetic associations with 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations from the Study of Underlying Genetic Determinants of Vitamin D and Highly Related Traits (SUNLIGHT) meta-analyses of European ancestry and to identify genetic variants related to vitamin D concentrations in African and Hispanic ancestries. Ancestry-specific (Hispanic and African) and transethnic (Hispanic, African, and European) meta-analyses were performed with Meta-Analysis Helper software (METAL). In total, 8541 African American and 3485 Hispanic American (from North America) participants from 12 cohorts and 16,124 European participants from SUNLIGHT were included in the study. Blood concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured for all participants. Ancestry-specific analyses in African and Hispanic Americans replicated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GC (2 and 4 SNPs, respectively). An SNP (rs79666294) near the KIF4B gene was identified in the African American cohort. Transethnic evaluation replicated GC and DHCR7 region SNPs. Additionally, the transethnic analyses revealed SNPs rs719700 and rs1410656 near the ANO6/ARID2 and HTR2A genes, respectively. Ancestry-specific and transethnic GWASs of 25(OH)D confirmed findings in GC and DHCR7 for African and Hispanic American samples and revealed findings near KIF4B, ANO6/ARID2, and HTR2A. The biological mechanisms that link these regions with 25(OH)D metabolism warrant further investigation.	
29315502	A Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Candidate Gene Associated With Atazanavir Exposure Measured in Hair.	Hair provides a direct measure of long-term exposure of atazanavir (ATV). We report the results of the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ATV exposure measured in hair in an observational cohort representative of US women living with HIV; the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Approximately 14.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in linear regression-based GWAS, with replication, adjusted for nongenetic predictors collected under conditions of actual use of ATV in 398 participants. Lastly, the PharmGKB database was used to identify pharmacogene associations with ATV exposure. The rs73208473, within intron 1 of SORCS2, resulted in a 0.46-fold decrease in ATV exposure, with the strongest association (P = 1.71×10(-8) ) in GWAS. A priori pharmacogene screening did not identify additional variants statistically significantly associated with ATV exposure, including those previously published in ATV plasma candidate pharmacogene studies. The findings demonstrate the potential value of pharmacogenomic GWAS in ethnically diverse populations under conditions of actual use.	
29325096	Genetic Determinants of Circulating Estrogen Levels and Evidence of a Causal Effect of Estradiol on Bone Density in Men.	Serum estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) levels exhibit substantial heritability. To investigate the genetic regulation of serum E2 and E1 in men. Genome-wide association study in 11,097 men of European origin from nine epidemiological cohorts. Genetic determinants of serum E2 and E1 levels. Variants in/near CYP19A1 demonstrated the strongest evidence for association with E2, resolving to three independent signals. Two additional independent signals were found on the X chromosome; FAMily with sequence similarity 9, member B (FAM9B), rs5934505 (P = 3.4 × 10-8) and Xq27.3, rs5951794 (P = 3.1 × 10-10). E1 signals were found in CYP19A1 (rs2899472, P = 5.5 × 10-23), in Tripartite motif containing 4 (TRIM4; rs17277546, P = 5.8 × 10-14), and CYP11B1/B2 (rs10093796, P = 1.2 × 10-8). E2 signals in CYP19A1 and FAM9B were associated with bone mineral density (BMD). Mendelian randomization analysis suggested a causal effect of serum E2 on BMD in men. A 1 pg/mL genetically increased E2 was associated with a 0.048 standard deviation increase in lumbar spine BMD (P = 2.8 × 10-12). In men and women combined, CYP19A1 alleles associated with higher E2 levels were associated with lower degrees of insulin resistance. Our findings confirm that CYP19A1 is an important genetic regulator of E2 and E1 levels and strengthen the causal importance of E2 for bone health in men. We also report two independent loci on the X-chromosome for E2, and one locus each in TRIM4 and CYP11B1/B2, for E1.	
29317604	Beta-defensin 1, aryl hydrocarbon receptor and plasma kynurenine in major depressive disorder: metabolomics-informed genomics.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous disease. Efforts to identify biomarkers for sub-classifying MDD and antidepressant therapy by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) alone have generally yielded disappointing results. We applied a metabolomics-informed genomic research strategy to study the contribution of genetic variation to MDD pathophysiology by assaying 31 metabolites, including compounds from the tryptophan, tyrosine, and purine pathways, in plasma samples from 290 MDD patients. Associations of metabolite concentrations with depressive symptoms were determined, followed by GWAS for selected metabolites and functional validation studies of the genes identified. Kynurenine (KYN), the baseline plasma metabolite that was most highly associated with depressive symptoms, was negatively correlated with severity of those symptoms. GWAS for baseline plasma KYN concentrations identified SNPs across the beta-defensin 1 (DEFB1) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) genes that were cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for DEFB1 and AHR mRNA expression, respectively. Furthermore, the DEFB1 locus was associated with severity of MDD symptoms in a larger cohort of 803 MDD patients. Functional studies demonstrated that DEFB1 could neutralize lipopolysaccharide-stimulated expression of KYN-biosynthesizing enzymes in monocytic cells, resulting in altered KYN concentrations in the culture media. In addition, we demonstrated that AHR was involved in regulating the expression of enzymes in the KYN pathway and altered KYN biosynthesis in cell lines of hepatocyte and astrocyte origin. In conclusion, these studies identified SNPs that were cis-eQTLs for DEFB1 and AHR and, which were associated with variation in plasma KYN concentrations that were related to severity of MDD symptoms.	
29317602	Genome-wide meta-analyses of stratified depression in Generation Scotland and UK Biobank.	Few replicable genetic associations for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have been identified. Recent studies of MDD have identified common risk variants by using a broader phenotype definition in very large samples, or by reducing phenotypic and ancestral heterogeneity. We sought to ascertain whether it is more informative to maximize the sample size using data from all available cases and controls, or to use a sex or recurrent stratified subset of affected individuals. To test this, we compared heritability estimates, genetic correlation with other traits, variance explained by MDD polygenic score, and variants identified by genome-wide meta-analysis for broad and narrow MDD classifications in two large British cohorts - Generation Scotland and UK Biobank. Genome-wide meta-analysis of MDD in males yielded one genome-wide significant locus on 3p22.3, with three genes in this region (CRTAP, GLB1, and TMPPE) demonstrating a significant association in gene-based tests. Meta-analyzed MDD, recurrent MDD and female MDD yielded equivalent heritability estimates, showed no detectable difference in association with polygenic scores, and were each genetically correlated with six health-correlated traits (neuroticism, depressive symptoms, subjective well-being, MDD, a cross-disorder phenotype and Bipolar Disorder). Whilst stratified GWAS analysis revealed a genome-wide significant locus for male MDD, the lack of independent replication, and the consistent pattern of results in other MDD classifications suggests that phenotypic stratification using recurrence or sex in currently available sample sizes is currently weakly justified. Based upon existing studies and our findings, the strategy of maximizing sample sizes is likely to provide the greater gain.	
29326435	A combined analysis of genetically correlated traits identifies 187 loci and a role for neurogenesis and myelination in intelligence.	Intelligence, or general cognitive function, is phenotypically and genetically correlated with many traits, including a wide range of physical, and mental health variables. Education is strongly genetically correlated with intelligence (r(g) = 0.70). We used these findings as foundations for our use of a novel approach-multi-trait analysis of genome-wide association studies (MTAG; Turley et al. 2017)-to combine two large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of education and intelligence, increasing statistical power and resulting in the largest GWAS of intelligence yet reported. Our study had four goals: first, to facilitate the discovery of new genetic loci associated with intelligence; second, to add to our understanding of the biology of intelligence differences; third, to examine whether combining genetically correlated traits in this way produces results consistent with the primary phenotype of intelligence; and, finally, to test how well this new meta-analytic data sample on intelligence predicts phenotypic intelligence in an independent sample. By combining datasets using MTAG, our functional sample size increased from 199,242 participants to 248,482. We found 187 independent loci associated with intelligence, implicating 538 genes, using both SNP-based and gene-based GWAS. We found evidence that neurogenesis and myelination-as well as genes expressed in the synapse, and those involved in the regulation of the nervous system-may explain some of the biological differences in intelligence. The results of our combined analysis demonstrated the same pattern of genetic correlations as those from previous GWASs of intelligence, providing support for the meta-analysis of these genetically-related phenotypes.	
29324852	Real-life helping behaviours in North America: A genome-wide association approach.	In humans, prosocial behaviour is essential for social functioning. Twin studies suggest this distinct human trait to be partly hardwired. In the last decade research on the genetics of prosocial behaviour focused on neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, such as oxytocin, dopamine, and their respective pathways. Recent trends towards large scale medical studies targeting the genetic basis of complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia pave the way for new directions also in behavioural genetics. Based on data from 10,713 participants of the American Health and Retirement Study we estimated heritability of helping behaviour-its total variance explained by 1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms-to be 11%. Both, fixed models and mixed linear models identified rs11697300, an intergene variant on chromosome 20, as a candidate variant moderating this particular helping behaviour. We assume that this so far undescribed area is worth further investigation in association with human prosocial behaviour.	
29478698	Genome-wide Association Study Identifies a Regulatory Variant of RGMA Associated With Opioid Dependence in European Americans.	Opioid dependence (OD) is at epidemic levels in the United States. Genetic studies can provide insight into its biology. We completed an OD genome-wide association study in 3058 opioid-exposed European Americans, 1290 of whom met criteria for a DSM-IV diagnosis of OD. Analysis used DSM-IV criterion count. By meta-analysis of four cohorts, Yale-Penn 1 (n = 1388), Yale-Penn 2 (n = 996), Yale-Penn 3 (n = 98), and SAGE (Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment) (n = 576), we identified a variant on chromosome 15, rs12442183, near RGMA, associated with OD (p = 1.3 × 10(-8)). The association was also genome-wide significant in Yale-Penn 1 taken individually and nominally significant in two of the other three samples. The finding was further supported in a meta-analysis of all available opioid-exposed African Americans (n = 2014 [1106 meeting DSM-IV OD criteria]; p = 3.0 × 10(-3)) from three cohorts; there was nominal significance in two of these samples. Thus, of seven subsamples examined in two populations, one was genome-wide significant, and four of six were nominally (or nearly) significant. RGMA encodes repulsive guidance molecule A, which is a central nervous system axon guidance protein. Risk allele rs12442183*T was correlated with higher expression of a specific RGMA transcript variant in frontal cortex (p = 2 × 10(-3)). After chronic morphine injection, the homologous mouse gene (Rgma) was upregulated in C57BL/6J striatum. Coexpression analysis of 1301 brain samples revealed that RGMA messenger RNA expression was associated with that of four genes implicated in other psychiatric disorders, including GRIN1. This is the first study to demonstrate an association of RGMA with OD. It provides a new lead into our understanding of OD pathophysiology.	
29331962	Splicing variant of 	Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of rare autoimmune diseases in which both genetic and environmental factors play important roles. To identify genetic factors of IIM including polymyositis, dermatomyositis (DM) and clinically amyopathic DM (CADM), we performed the first genome-wide association study for IIM in an Asian population. We genotyped and tested 496 819 single nucleotide polymorphism for association using 576 patients with IIM and 6270 control subjects. We also examined the causal mechanism of disease-associated variants by in silico analyses using publicly available data sets as well as by in in vitro analyses using reporter assays and apoptosis assays. We identified a variant in(WDFY4) that was significantly associated with CADM (rs7919656; OR=3.87; P=1.5×10(-8)). This variant had a cis-splicing quantitative trait locus (QTL) effect for a truncated(WDFY4)isoform (tr-(WDFY4)), with higher expression in the risk allele. Transexpression QTL analysis of this variant showed a positive correlation with the expression of NF-κB associated genes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both WDFY4 and tr-WDFY4 interacted with pattern recognition receptors such as TLR3, TLR4, TLR9 and MDA5 and augmented the NF-κB activation by these receptors. WDFY4 isoforms also enhanced MDA5-induced apoptosis to a greater extent in the tr-WDFY4-transfected cells. As CADM is characterised by the appearance of anti-MDA5 autoantibodies and severe lung inflammation, the WDFY4 variant may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CADM.	
29346644	Genome-wide analysis of disease progression in age-related macular degeneration.	Family- and population-based genetic studies have successfully identified multiple disease-susceptibility loci for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the first batch and most successful examples of genome-wide association study. However, most genetic studies to date have focused on case-control studies of late AMD (choroidal neovascularization or geographic atrophy). The genetic influences on disease progression are largely unexplored. We assembled unique resources to perform a genome-wide bivariate time-to-event analysis to test for association of time-to-late-AMD with ∼9 million variants on 2721 Caucasians from a large multi-center randomized clinical trial, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide association study of disease progression (bivariate survival outcome) in AMD genetic studies, thus providing novel insights to AMD genetics. We used a robust Cox proportional hazards model to appropriately account for between-eye correlation when analyzing the progression time in the two eyes of each participant. We identified four previously reported susceptibility loci showing genome-wide significant association with AMD progression: ARMS2-HTRA1 (P = 8.1 × 10-43), CFH (P = 3.5 × 10-37), C2-CFB-SKIV2L (P = 8.1 × 10-10) and C3 (P = 1.2 × 10-9). Furthermore, we detected association of rs58978565 near TNR (P = 2.3 × 10-8), rs28368872 near ATF7IP2 (P = 2.9 × 10-8) and rs142450006 near MMP9 (P = 0.0006) with progression to choroidal neovascularization but not geographic atrophy. Secondary analysis limited to 34 reported risk variants revealed that LIPC and CTRB2-CTRB1 were also associated with AMD progression (P < 0.0015). Our genome-wide analysis thus expands the genetics in both development and progression of AMD and should assist in early identification of high risk individuals.	
29343764	Genome-wide association study in 79,366 European-ancestry individuals informs the genetic architecture of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.	Vitamin D is a steroid hormone precursor that is associated with a range of human traits and diseases. Previous GWAS of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations have identified four genome-wide significant loci (GC, NADSYN1/DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP24A1). In this study, we expand the previous SUNLIGHT Consortium GWAS discovery sample size from 16,125 to 79,366 (all European descent). This larger GWAS yields two additional loci harboring genome-wide significant variants (P = 4.7×10(-9) at rs8018720 in SEC23A, and P = 1.9×10(-14) at rs10745742 in AMDHD1). The overall estimate of heritability of 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations attributable to GWAS common SNPs is 7.5%, with statistically significant loci explaining 38% of this total. Further investigation identifies signal enrichment in immune and hematopoietic tissues, and clustering with autoimmune diseases in cell-type-specific analysis. Larger studies are required to identify additional common SNPs, and to explore the role of rare or structural variants and gene-gene interactions in the heritability of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.	
29348612	GWAS in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia reveals novel genetic associations at chromosomes 17q12 and 8q24.21.	Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (age 0-14 years) is 20% more common in Latino Americans than non-Latino whites. We conduct a genome-wide association study in a large sample of 3263 Californian children with ALL (including 1949 of Latino heritage) and 3506 controls matched on month and year of birth, sex, and ethnicity, and an additional 12,471 controls from the Kaiser Resource for Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging Cohort. Replication of the strongest genetic associations is performed in two independent datasets from the Children's Oncology Group and the California Childhood Leukemia Study. Here we identify new risk loci on 17q12 near IKZF3/ZPBP2/GSDMB/ORMDL3, a locus encompassing a transcription factor important for lymphocyte development (IKZF3), and at an 8q24 region known for structural contacts with the MYC oncogene. These new risk loci may impact gene expression via local (four 17q12 genes) or long-range (8q24) interactions, affecting function of well-characterized hematopoietic and growth-regulation pathways.	
29360470	CDK5RAP2 gene and tau pathophysiology in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease.	Because currently known Alzheimer's disease (AD) single-nucleotide polymorphisms only account for a small fraction of the genetic variance in this disease, there is a need to identify new variants associated with AD. Our team performed a genome-wide association study in the Quebec Founder Population isolate to identify novel protective or risk genetic factors for late-onset sporadic AD and examined the impact of these variants on gene expression and AD pathology. The rs10984186 variant is associated with an increased risk of developing AD and with a higher CDK5RAP2 mRNA prevalence in the hippocampus. On the other hand, the rs4837766 variant, which is among the best cis-expression quantitative trait loci in the CDK5RAP2 gene, is associated with lower mild cognitive impairment/AD risk and conversion rate. The rs10984186 risk and rs4837766 protective polymorphic variants of the CDK5RAP2 gene might act as potent genetic modifiers for AD risk and/or conversion by modulating the expression of this gene.	
29356057	Genetic risk of prostate cancer in Ugandan men.	Men of African-ancestry have elevated prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality compared to men of other racial groups. There is support for a genetic contribution to this disparity, with evidence of genetic heterogeneity in the underlying risk alleles between populations. Studies of PCa among African men may inform the contribution of genetic risk factors to the elevated disease burden in this population. We conducted an association study of >100 previously reported PCa risk alleles among 571 incidence cases and 485 controls among Uganda men. Unconditional logistic regression was used to test genetic associations and a polygenic risk score (PRS) was derived to assess the cumulative effect of the known risk alleles in association with PCa risk. In an exploratory analysis, we also tested associations of 17 125 421 genotyped and imputed markers genome-wide in association with PCa risk. Of the 111 known risk loci with a frequency >1%, 75 (68%) had effects that were directionally consistent with the initial discovery population,14 (13%) of which were nominally significantly associated with PCa risk at P < 0.05. Compared to men with average risk (25(th) -75(th) percentile in PRS distribution), Ugandan men in the top 10% of the PRS, constructed of alleles outside of 8q24, had a 2.9-fold (95%CI: 1.75, 4.97) risk of developing PCa; risk for the top 10% increased to 4.86 (95%CI: 2.70, 8.76) with the inclusion of risk alleles at 8q24. In genome-wide association testing, the strongest associations were noted with known risk alleles located in the 8q24 region, including rs72725854 (OR = 3.37, P = 2.14 × 10(-11) ) that is limited to populations of African ancestry (6% frequency). The ∼100 known PCa risk variants were shown to effectively stratify PCa risk in Ugandan men, with 10% of men having a >4-fold increase in risk. The 8q24 risk region was also found to be a major contributor to PCa risk in Ugandan men, with the African ancestry-specific risk variant rs72725854 estimated to account for 12% of PCa in this population.	
29358691	Re-analysis of public genetic data reveals a rare X-chromosomal variant associated with type 2 diabetes.	The reanalysis of existing GWAS data represents a powerful and cost-effective opportunity to gain insights into the genetics of complex diseases. By reanalyzing publicly available type 2 diabetes (T2D) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data for 70,127 subjects, we identify seven novel associated regions, five driven by common variants (LYPLAL1, NEUROG3, CAMKK2, ABO, and GIP genes), one by a low-frequency (EHMT2), and one driven by a rare variant in chromosome Xq23, rs146662057, associated with a twofold increased risk for T2D in males. rs146662057 is located within an active enhancer associated with the expression of Angiotensin II Receptor type 2 gene (AGTR2), a modulator of insulin sensitivity, and exhibits allelic specific activity in muscle cells. Beyond providing insights into the genetics and pathophysiology of T2D, these results also underscore the value of reanalyzing publicly available data using novel genetic resources and analytical approaches.	
29395996	Cerebral tryptophan metabolism and outcome of tuberculous meningitis: an observational cohort study.	Immunopathology contributes to the high mortality of tuberculous meningitis, but the biological pathways involved are mostly unknown. We aimed to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum metabolomes of patients with tuberculous meningitis with that of controls without tuberculous meningitis, and assess the link between metabolite concentrations and mortality. In this observational cohort study at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital (Bandung, Indonesia) we measured 425 metabolites using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in CSF and serum from 33 HIV-negative Indonesian patients with confirmed or probable tuberculous meningitis and 22 control participants with complete clinical data between March 12, 2009, and Oct 27, 2013. Associations of metabolite concentrations with survival were validated in a second cohort of 101 patients from the same centre. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism typing was used to identify tryptophan quantitative trait loci, which were used for survival analysis in a third cohort of 285 patients. Concentrations of 250 (70%) of 351 metabolites detected in CSF were higher in patients with tuberculous meningitis than in controls, especially in those who died during follow-up. Only five (1%) of the 390 metobolites detected in serum differed between patients with tuberculous meningitis and controls. CSF tryptophan concentrations showed a pattern different from most other CSF metabolites; concentrations were lower in patients who survived compared with patients who died (9-times) and to controls (31-times). The association of low CSF tryptophan with patient survival was confirmed in the validation cohort (hazard ratio 0·73; 95% CI 0·64-0·83; p<0·0001; per each halving). 11 genetic loci predictive for CSF tryptophan concentrations in tuberculous meningitis were identified (p<0·00001). These quantitative trait loci predicted survival in a third cohort of 285 HIV-negative patients in a prognostic index including age and sex, also after correction for possible confounders (p=0·0083). Cerebral tryptophan metabolism, which is known to affect Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth and CNS inflammation, is important for the outcome of tuberculous meningitis. CSF tryptophan concentrations in tuberculous meningitis are under strong genetic influence, probably contributing to the variable outcomes of tuberculous meningitis. Interventions targeting tryptophan metabolism could improve outcomes of tuberculous meningitis.

29367611	Genome-wide association study of paclitaxel and carboplatin disposition in women with epithelial ovarian cancer.	Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence chemotherapy disposition may help to personalize cancer treatment and limit toxicity. Genome-wide approaches are unbiased, compared with candidate gene studies, but usually require large cohorts. As most chemotherapy is given cyclically multiple blood sampling is required to adequately define drug disposition, limiting patient recruitment. We found that carboplatin and paclitaxel disposition are stable phenotypes in ovarian cancer patients and tested a genome-wide association study (GWAS) design to identify SNPs associated with chemotherapy disposition. We found highly significant SNPs in ABCC2, a known carboplatin transporter, associated with carboplatin clearance (asymptotic P = 5.2 × 10(6), empirical P = 1.4 × 10(-5)), indicating biological plausibility. We also identified novel SNPs associated with paclitaxel disposition, including rs17130142 with genome-wide significance (asymptotic P = 2.0 × 10(-9), empirical P = 1.3 × 10(-7)). Although requiring further validation, our work demonstrated that GWAS of chemotherapeutic drug disposition can be effective, even in relatively small cohorts, and can be adopted in drug development and treatment programs.	
29367735	A genome-wide association study in the Japanese population identifies the 12q24 locus for habitual coffee consumption: The J-MICC Study.	Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, and its role in human health has received much attention. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have investigated genetic variants associated with coffee consumption in European populations, no such study has yet been conducted in an Asian population. Here, we conducted a GWAS to identify common genetic variations that affected coffee consumption in a Japanese population of 11,261 participants recruited as a part of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) study. Coffee consumption was collected using a self-administered questionnaire, and converted from categories to cups/day. In the discovery stage (n = 6,312), we found 2 independent loci (12q24.12-13 and 5q33.3) that met suggestive significance (P < 1 × 10(-6)). In the replication stage (n = 4,949), the lead variant for the 12q24.12-13 locus (rs2074356) was significantly associated with habitual coffee consumption (P = 2.2 × 10(-6)), whereas the lead variant for the 5q33.3 locus (rs1957553) was not (P = 0.53). A meta-analysis of the discovery and replication populations, and the combined analysis using all subjects, revealed that rs2074356 achieved genome-wide significance (P = 2.2 × 10(-16) for a meta-analysis). These findings indicate that the 12q24.12-13 locus is associated with coffee consumption among a Japanese population.	
29374233	GWAS of epigenetic aging rates in blood reveals a critical role for TERT.	DNA methylation age is an accurate biomarker of chronological age and predicts lifespan, but its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In this genome-wide association study of 9907 individuals, we find gene variants mapping to five loci associated with intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA) and gene variants in three loci associated with extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA). Mendelian randomization analysis suggests causal influences of menarche and menopause on IEAA and lipoproteins on IEAA and EEAA. Variants associated with longer leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT) paradoxically confer higher IEAA (P < 2.7 × 10(-11)). Causal modeling indicates TERT-specific and independent effects on LTL and IEAA. Experimental hTERT-expression in primary human fibroblasts engenders a linear increase in DNA methylation age with cell population doubling number. Together, these findings indicate a critical role for hTERT in regulating the epigenetic clock, in addition to its established role of compensating for cell replication-dependent telomere shortening.	
29404214	Gene-based association study for lipid traits in diverse cohorts implicates 	Plasma lipid levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death worldwide. While many studies have been conducted on lipid genetics, they mainly focus on Europeans and thus their transferability to diverse populations is unclear. We performed SNP- and gene-level genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of four lipid traits in cohorts from Nigeria and the Philippines and compared them to the results of larger, predominantly European meta-analyses. Two previously implicated loci met genome-wide significance in our SNP-level GWAS in the Nigerian cohort, rs34065661 in(CETP) associated with HDL cholesterol ((P) = 9.0 × 10(-10)) and rs1065853 upstream of(APOE) associated with LDL cholesterol ((P) = 6.6 × 10(-9)). The top SNP in the Filipino cohort associated with triglyceride levels (rs662799;(P) = 2.7 × 10(-16)) and has been previously implicated in other East Asian studies. While this SNP is located directly upstream of well known(APOA5), we show it may also be involved in the regulation of(BACE1) and(SIDT2). Our gene-based association analysis, PrediXcan, revealed decreased expression of(BACE1) and decreased expression of(SIDT2) in several tissues, all driven by rs662799, significantly associate with increased triglyceride levels in Filipinos (FDR <0.1). In addition, our PrediXcan analysis implicated gene regulation as the mechanism underlying the associations of many other previously discovered lipid loci. Our novel(BACE1) and(SIDT2) findings were confirmed using summary statistics from the Global Lipids Genetic Consortium (GLGC) meta-GWAS.	
29379196	Genome-wide association study of Hirschsprung disease detects a novel low-frequency variant at the RET locus.	Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder with a population incidence of ~1/5000 live births, defined by an absence of enteric ganglia along variable lengths of the colon. HSCR genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found common associated variants at RET, SEMA3, and NRG1, but they still fail to explain all of its heritability. To enhance gene discovery, we performed a GWAS of 170 cases identified from the Danish nationwide pathology registry with 4717 controls, based on 6.2 million variants imputed from the haplotype reference consortium panel. We found a novel low-frequency variant (rs144432435), which, when conditioning on the lead RET single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), was of genome-wide significance in the discovery analysis. This conditional association signal was replicated in a Swedish HSCR cohort with discovery plus replication meta-analysis conditional odds ratio of 6.6 (P = 7.7 × 10(-10); 322 cases and 4893 controls). The conditional signal was, however, not replicated in two HSCR cohorts from USA and Finland, leading to the hypothesis that rs144432435 tags a rare haplotype present in Denmark and Sweden. Using the genome-wide complex trait analysis method, we estimated the SNP heritability of HSCR to be 88%, close to estimates based on classical family studies. Moreover, by using Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression we were able to construct a genetic HSCR predictor with a area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 76% in an independent validation set. In conclusion, we combined the largest collection of sporadic Hirschsprung cases to date (586 cases) to further elucidate HSCR's genetic architecture.	
29381699	Novel genetic polymorphisms associated with severe malaria and under selective pressure in North-eastern Tanzania.	Significant selection pressure has been exerted on the genomes of human populations exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection, resulting in the acquisition of mechanisms of resistance against severe malarial disease. Many host genetic factors, including sickle cell trait, have been associated with reduced risk of developing severe malaria, but do not account for all of the observed phenotypic variation. Identification of novel inherited risk factors relies upon high-resolution genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We present findings of a GWAS of severe malaria performed in a Tanzanian population (n = 914, 15.2 million SNPs). Beyond the expected association with the sickle cell HbS variant, we identify protective associations within two interleukin receptors (IL-23R and IL-12RBR2) and the kelch-like protein KLHL3 (all P<10-6), as well as near significant effects for Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotypes. Complementary analyses, based on detecting extended haplotype homozygosity, identified SYNJ2BP, GCLC and MHC as potential loci under recent positive selection. Through whole genome sequencing of an independent Tanzanian cohort (parent-child trios n = 247), we confirm the allele frequencies of common polymorphisms underlying associations and selection, as well as the presence of multiple structural variants that could be in linkage with these SNPs. Imputation of structural variants in a region encompassing the glycophorin genes on chromosome 4, led to the characterisation of more than 50 rare variants, and individually no strong evidence of associations with severe malaria in our primary dataset (P>0.3). Our approach demonstrates the potential of a joint genotyping-sequencing strategy to identify as-yet unknown susceptibility loci in an African population with well-characterised malaria phenotypes. The regions encompassing these loci are potential targets for the design of much needed interventions for preventing or treating malarial disease.	
29397368	A Genome-Wide Association Study Finds Genetic Associations with Broadly-Defined Headache in UK Biobank (N=223,773).	Headache is the most common neurological symptom and a leading cause of years lived with disability. We sought to identify the genetic variants associated with a broadly-defined headache phenotype in 223,773 subjects from the UK Biobank cohort. We defined headache based on a specific question answered by the UK Biobank participants. We performed a genome-wide association study of headache as a single entity, using 74,461 cases and 149,312 controls. We identified 3343 SNPs which reached the genome-wide significance level of P<5×10(-8). The SNPs were located in 28 loci, with the top SNP of rs11172113 in the LRP1 gene having a P value of 4.92×10(-47). Of the 28 loci, 14 have previously been associated with migraine. Among 14 new loci, rs77804065 with a P value of 5.87×10(-15) in the LINC02210-CRHR1 gene was the top SNP. Significant relationships between multiple brain tissues and genetic associations were identified through tissue expression analysis. We also identified significant positive genetic correlations between headache and many psychological traits. Our results suggest that brain function is closely related to broadly-defined headache. In addition, we found that many psychological traits have genetic correlations with headache.	
29385134	Risk estimation model for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the Japanese using multiple genetic markers.	The genetic factors affecting the natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and NASH-derived hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC), are still unknown. In the current study, we sought to identify genetic factors related to the development of NAFLD, NASH, and NASH-HCC, and to establish risk-estimation models for them. For these purposes, 936 histologically proven NAFLD patients were recruited, and genome-wide association (GWA) studies were conducted for 902, including 476 NASH and 58 NASH-HCC patients, against 7,672 general-population controls. Risk estimations for NAFLD and NASH were then performed using the SNPs identified as having significant associations in the GWA studies. We found that rs2896019 in PNPLA3 [p = 2.3x10-31, OR (95%CI) = 1.85 (1.67-2.05)], rs1260326 in GCKR [p = 9.6x10-10, OR (95%CI) = 1.38(1.25-1.53)], and rs4808199 in GATAD2A [p = 2.3x10-8, OR (95%CI) = 1.37 (1.23-1.53)] were significantly associated with NAFLD. Notably, the number of risk alleles in PNPLA3 and GATAD2A was much higher in Matteoni type 4 (NASH) patients than in type 1, type 2, and type 3 NAFLD patients. In addition, we newly identified rs17007417 in DYSF [p = 5.2x10-7, OR (95%CI) = 2.74 (1.84-4.06)] as a SNP associated with NASH-HCC. Rs641738 in TMC4, which showed association with NAFLD in patients of European descent, was not replicated in our study (p = 0.73), although the complicated LD pattern in the region suggests the necessity for further investigation. The genetic variants of PNPLA3, GCKR, and GATAD2A were then used to estimate the risk for NAFLD. The obtained Polygenic Risk Scores showed that the risk for NAFLD increased with the accumulation of risk alleles [AUC (95%CI) = 0.65 (0.63-0.67)]. We demonstrated that NASH is genetically and clinically different from the other NAFLD subgroups. We also established risk-estimation models for NAFLD and NASH using multiple genetic markers. These models can be used to improve the accuracy of NAFLD diagnosis and to guide treatment decisions for patients.	
29378355	A Genome-wide Study of Common and Rare Genetic Variants Associated with Circulating Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor.	Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) plays a central role in haemostasis, and plasma TAFI concentrations are heritable. Candidate gene studies have identified several variants within the gene encoding TAFI,(CPB2), that explain part of the estimated heritability. Here, we describe an exploratory genome-wide association study to identify novel variants within and outside of the(CPB2) locus that influence plasma concentrations of intact TAFI and/or the extent of TAFI activation (measured by released TAFI activation peptide, TAFI-AP) amongst 3,260 subjects from Southern Sweden. We also explored the role of rare variants on the HumanExome BeadChip. We confirmed the association with previously reported common variants in(CPB2) for both intact TAFI and TAFI-AP, and discovered novel associations with variants in putative(CPB2) enhancers. We identified a gene-based association with intact TAFI at(CPB2) ((P)(SKAT-O) = 2.8 × 10(-8)), driven by two novel rare nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; I420N and D177G). Carriers of the rare variant of D177G (rs140446990; MAF 0.2%) had lower intact TAFI and TAFI-AP concentrations compared with non-carriers (intact TAFI, geometric mean 53 vs. 78%,(P)(T-test) (=) 5 × 10(-7); TAFI-AP 63 vs. 99%,(P)(T-test) = 7.2 × 10(-4)). For TAFI-AP, we identified a genome-wide significant association at an intergenic region of chromosome 3p14.1 and five gene-based associations (all(P)(SKAT-O) < 5 × 10(-6)). Using well-characterized assays together with a genome-wide association study and a rare-variant approach, we verified(CPB2) to be the primary determinant of TAFI concentrations and identified putative secondary loci (candidate variants and genes) associated with intact TAFI and TAFI-AP that require independent validation.	
29398083	Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Variants in CFH and CFHR4 Associated with Systemic Complement Activation: Implications in Age-Related Macular Degeneration.	To identify genetic variants associated with complement activation, which may help to select age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients for complement-inhibiting therapies. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) followed by replication and meta-analysis. AMD patients and controls (n = 2245). A GWAS on serum C3d-to-C3 ratio was performed in 1548 AMD patients and controls. For replication and meta-analysis, 697 additional individuals were genotyped. A model for complement activation including genetic and non-genetic factors was built, and the variance explained was estimated. Haplotype analysis was performed for 8 SNPs across the CFH/CFHR locus. Association with AMD was performed for the variants and haplotypes found to influence complement activation. Normalized C3d/C3 ratio as a measure of systemic complement activation. Complement activation was associated independently with rs3753396 located in CFH (P(discovery) = 1.09 × 10(-15); P(meta) = 3.66 × 10(-21); β = 0.141; standard error [SE] = 0.015) and rs6685931 located in CFHR4 (P(discovery) = 8.18 × 10(-7); P(meta) = 6.32 × 10(-8); β = 0.054; SE = 0.010). A model including age, AMD disease status, body mass index, triglycerides, rs3753396, rs6685931, and previously identified SNPs explained 18.7% of the variability in complement activation. Haplotype analysis revealed 3 haplotypes (H1-2 and H6 containing rs6685931 and H3 containing rs3753396) associated with complement activation. Haplotypes H3 and H6 conferred stronger effects on complement activation compared with the single variants (P = 2.53 × 10(-14); β = 0.183; SE = 0.024; and P = 4.28 × 10(-4); β = 0.144; SE = 0.041; respectively). Association analyses with AMD revealed that SNP rs6685931 and haplotype H1-2 containing rs6685931 were associated with a risk for AMD development, whereas SNP rs3753396 and haplotypes H3 and H6 were not. The SNP rs3753396 in CFH and SNP rs6685931 in CFHR4 are associated with systemic complement activation levels. The SNP rs6685931 in CFHR4 and its linked haplotype H1-2 also conferred a risk for AMD development, and therefore could be used to identify AMD patients who would benefit most from complement-inhibiting therapies.	
29278617	Genome-wide meta-analyses identifies novel taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy-associated loci.	Taxane containing chemotherapy extends survival for breast cancer patients. However, taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) cannot be predicted, prevented or effectively treated. Using genome-wide analyses, we sought to identify common risk variants for TIPN. Women with high-risk breast cancer enrolled in SWOG 0221 were genotyped using the Illumina 1M chip. Genome-wide analyses were performed in relation to ≥grade 3 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) neuropathy in European and African Americans. Data were meta-analyzed with GW associations of CTCAE ≥grade 3 versus <grade 3 in CALGB 40101 assuming a fixed effects model. The percentage of ≥grade 3 TIPN in 1269 European Americans and 139 African Americans in S0221, was 11.6 and 22.3%, respectively. CALGB 40101 ≥grade 3 TOPN was 7.2%. The most significant association with ≥grade 3 TIPN was the G allele of rs1858826 in GNGT1 (Pmeta=1.1×10), which showed a decrease in risk of ≥grade 3 TIPN (odds ratio=0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.46). The genetic variants associated with ≥grade 3 TIPN are hypothesized to have biochemical functions and reside in and near genes involved in diabetes and diabetic neuropathy. This finding is consistent with results from CALGB 40101 pathway analyses. Larger homogeneous trials with similar dosing and criteria for defining neuropathy are needed to properly assess the relationship of genomics with the neuropathy spectrum.	
29394082	A Genome-Wide Association Study in Hispanics/Latinos Identifies Novel Signals for Lung Function. The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.	Lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are heritable traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous pulmonary function and COPD loci, primarily in cohorts of European ancestry. Perform a GWAS of COPD phenotypes in Hispanic/Latino populations to identify loci not previously detected in European populations. GWAS of lung function and COPD in Hispanic/Latino participants from a population-based cohort. We performed replication studies of novel loci in independent studies. Among 11,822 Hispanic/Latino participants, we identified eight novel signals; three replicated in independent populations of European Ancestry. A novel locus for FEV(1) in ZSWIM7 (rs4791658; P = 4.99 × 10(-9)) replicated. A rare variant (minor allele frequency = 0.002) in HAL (rs145174011) was associated with FEV(1)/FVC (P = 9.59 × 10(-9)) in a region previously identified for COPD-related phenotypes; it remained significant in conditional analyses but did not replicate. Admixture mapping identified a novel region, with a variant in AGMO (rs41331850), associated with Amerindian ancestry and FEV(1), which replicated. A novel locus for FEV(1) identified among ever smokers (rs291231; P = 1.92 × 10(-8)) approached statistical significance for replication in admixed populations of African ancestry, and a novel SNP for COPD in PDZD2 (rs7709630; P = 1.56 × 10(-8)) regionally replicated. In addition, loci previously identified for lung function in European samples were associated in Hispanic/Latino participants in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos at the genome-wide significance level. We identified novel signals for lung function and COPD in a Hispanic/Latino cohort. Including admixed populations when performing genetic studies may identify variants contributing to genetic etiologies of COPD.	
29391395	Genome-wide analysis of self-reported risk-taking behaviour and cross-disorder genetic correlations in the UK Biobank cohort.	Risk-taking behaviour is a key component of several psychiatric disorders and could influence lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol use, and diet. As a phenotype, risk-taking behaviour therefore fits within a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, whereby identifying genetic determinants of this trait has the potential to improve our understanding across different psychiatric disorders. Here we report a genome-wide association study in 116,255 UK Biobank participants who responded yes/no to the question "Would you consider yourself a risk taker?" Risk takers (compared with controls) were more likely to be men, smokers, and have a history of psychiatric disorder. Genetic loci associated with risk-taking behaviour were identified on chromosomes 3 (rs13084531) and 6 (rs9379971). The effects of both lead SNPs were comparable between men and women. The chromosome 3 locus highlights CADM2, previously implicated in cognitive and executive functions, but the chromosome 6 locus is challenging to interpret due to the complexity of the HLA region. Risk-taking behaviour shared significant genetic risk with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as with smoking and total obesity. Despite being based on only a single question, this study furthers our understanding of the biology of risk-taking behaviour, a trait that has a major impact on a range of common physical and mental health disorders.	
29391396	Bipolar disorder with binge eating behavior: a genome-wide association study implicates PRR5-ARHGAP8.	Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with binge eating behavior (BE), and both conditions are heritable. Previously, using data from the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) study of BD, we performed genome-wide association (GWA) analyses of BD with BE comorbidity. Here, utilizing data from the Mayo Clinic BD Biobank (969 BD cases, 777 controls), we performed a GWA analysis of a BD subtype defined by BE, and case-only analysis comparing BD subjects with and without BE. We then performed a meta-analysis of the Mayo and GAIN results. The meta-analysis provided genome-wide significant evidence of association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PRR5-ARHGAP8 and BE in BD cases (rs726170 OR = 1.91, P = 3.05E-08). In the meta-analysis comparing cases with BD with comorbid BE vs. non-BD controls, a genome-wide significant association was observed at SNP rs111940429 in an intergenic region near PPP1R2P5 (p = 1.21E-08). PRR5-ARHGAP8 is a read-through transcript resulting in a fusion protein of PRR5 and ARHGAP8. PRR5 encodes a subunit of mTORC2, a serine/threonine kinase that participates in food intake regulation, while ARHGAP8 encodes a member of the RhoGAP family of proteins that mediate cross-talk between Rho GTPases and other signaling pathways. Without BE information in controls, it is not possible to determine whether the observed association reflects a risk factor for BE in general, risk for BE in individuals with BD, or risk of a subtype of BD with BE. The effect of PRR5-ARHGAP8 on BE risk thus warrants further investigation.	
29408531	The polymorphism rs671 at ALDH2 associated with serum uric acid levels in Chinese Han males: A genome-wide association study.	Serum uric acid (SUA) levels are highly heritable and an increased SUA level is one of important risk factors for gout, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The genetic variants underlying SUA remains largely unexplored. The aim was to explore new genetic variants underlying SUA in Chinese Han. We performed a genome-wide association study of SUA levels in Han Chinese. The discovery set contained 1634 samples and subsequent replication was comprised of 1649 females and 1169 males. 2620 subjects were recruited in the detailed analysis of rs671, alcohol drinking and SUA. We found a genome-wide significant association between SUA level and the SNP rs671 at ALDH2 (P = 1.2 × 10(-10)) in the merged data. In addition, we also replicated the signal from rs3733590 at SLC2A9 (P = 1.0 × 10(-10)). In males, about 0.21% to 1.95% of the total variance for SUA can be explained by rs671 using linear regression models in four independent cohorts. Of those, 56.75% to 93.51% might be explained by altering alcohol consumption due to rs671. No statistical association of rs671 and SUA was observed in females (P = 0.409). Furthermore, we observed a causal relationship between alcohol consumption and SUA in males using rs671 as an instrumental variable (P = 5.1 × 10(-4)). We replicated the previous findings in SLC2A9. Our evidence supported that rs671 was associated with SUA by affecting alcohol consumption in males. This finding strongly suggests a role for alcohol consumption in the development of hyperuricaemia and uric acid related traits.	
29404672	Meta-genome-wide association studies identify a locus on chromosome 1 and multiple variants in the MHC region for serum C-peptide in type 1 diabetes.	The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants associated with beta cell function in type 1 diabetes, as measured by serum C-peptide levels, through meta-genome-wide association studies (meta-GWAS). We performed a meta-GWAS to combine the results from five studies in type 1 diabetes with cross-sectionally measured stimulated, fasting or random C-peptide levels, including 3479 European participants. The p values across studies were combined, taking into account sample size and direction of effect. We also performed separate meta-GWAS for stimulated (n = 1303), fasting (n = 2019) and random (n = 1497) C-peptide levels. In the meta-GWAS for stimulated/fasting/random C-peptide levels, a SNP on chromosome 1, rs559047 (Chr1:238753916, T>A, minor allele frequency [MAF] 0.24-0.26), was associated with C-peptide (p = 4.13 × 10(-8)), meeting the genome-wide significance threshold (p < 5 × 10(-8)). In the same meta-GWAS, a locus in the MHC region (rs9260151) was close to the genome-wide significance threshold (Chr6:29911030, C>T, MAF 0.07-0.10, p = 8.43 × 10(-8)). In the stimulated C-peptide meta-GWAS, rs61211515 (Chr6:30100975, T/-, MAF 0.17-0.19) in the MHC region was associated with stimulated C-peptide (β [SE] = - 0.39 [0.07], p = 9.72 × 10(-8)). rs61211515 was also associated with the rate of stimulated C-peptide decline over time in a subset of individuals (n = 258) with annual repeated measures for up to 6 years (p = 0.02). In the meta-GWAS of random C-peptide, another MHC region, SNP rs3135002 (Chr6:32668439, C>A, MAF 0.02-0.06), was associated with C-peptide (p = 3.49 × 10(-8)). Conditional analyses suggested that the three identified variants in the MHC region were independent of each other. rs9260151 and rs3135002 have been associated with type 1 diabetes, whereas rs559047 and rs61211515 have not been associated with a risk of developing type 1 diabetes. We identified a locus on chromosome 1 and multiple variants in the MHC region, at least some of which were distinct from type 1 diabetes risk loci, that were associated with C-peptide, suggesting partly non-overlapping mechanisms for the development and progression of type 1 diabetes. These associations need to be validated in independent populations. Further investigations could provide insights into mechanisms of beta cell loss and opportunities to preserve beta cell function.	
29403010	Genetic analysis of quantitative traits in the Japanese population links cell types to complex human diseases.	Clinical measurements can be viewed as useful intermediate phenotypes to promote understanding of complex human diseases. To acquire comprehensive insights into the underlying genetics, here we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 58 quantitative traits in 162,255 Japanese individuals. Overall, we identified 1,407 trait-associated loci (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)), 679 of which were novel. By incorporating 32 additional GWAS results for complex diseases and traits in Japanese individuals, we further highlighted pleiotropy, genetic correlations, and cell-type specificity across quantitative traits and diseases, which substantially expands the current understanding of the associated genetics and biology. This study identified both shared polygenic effects and cell-type specificity, represented by the genetic links among clinical measurements, complex diseases, and relevant cell types. Our findings demonstrate that even without prior biological knowledge of cross-phenotype relationships, genetics corresponding to clinical measurements successfully recapture those measurements' relevance to diseases, and thus can contribute to the elucidation of unknown etiology and pathogenesis.	
29422769	A genome-wide association study of corneal astigmatism: The CREAM Consortium.	To identify genes and genetic markers associated with corneal astigmatism. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of corneal astigmatism undertaken for 14 European ancestry (n=22,250) and 8 Asian ancestry (n=9,120) cohorts was performed by the Consortium for Refractive Error and Myopia. Cases were defined as having >0.75 diopters of corneal astigmatism. Subsequent gene-based and gene-set analyses of the meta-analyzed results of European ancestry cohorts were performed using VEGAS2 and MAGMA software. Additionally, estimates of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability for corneal and refractive astigmatism and the spherical equivalent were calculated for Europeans using LD score regression. The meta-analysis of all cohorts identified a genome-wide significant locus near the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ((PDGFRA)) gene: top SNP: rs7673984, odds ratio=1.12 (95% CI:1.08-1.16), p=5.55×10(-9). No other genome-wide significant loci were identified in the combined analysis or European/Asian ancestry-specific analyses. Gene-based analysis identified three novel candidate genes for corneal astigmatism in Europeans-claudin-7 ((CLDN7)), acid phosphatase 2, lysosomal ((ACP2)), and TNF alpha-induced protein 8 like 3 ((TNFAIP8L3)). In addition to replicating a previously identified genome-wide significant locus for corneal astigmatism near the(PDGFRA) gene, gene-based analysis identified three novel candidate genes,(CLDN7),(ACP2), and(TNFAIP8L3), that warrant further investigation to understand their role in the pathogenesis of corneal astigmatism. The much lower number of genetic variants and genes demonstrating an association with corneal astigmatism compared to published spherical equivalent GWAS analyses suggest a greater influence of rare genetic variants, non-additive genetic effects, or environmental factors in the development of astigmatism.	
29436472	A novel variant in 	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex disease, but its genetic aetiology remains poorly characterised. To identify novel susceptibility loci for OA, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in individuals from the largest UK-based OA collections to date. We carried out a discovery GWAS in 5414 OA individuals with knee and/or hip total joint replacement (TJR) and 9939 population-based controls. We followed-up prioritised variants in OA subjects from the interim release of the UK Biobank resource (up to 12 658 cases and 50 898 controls) and our lead finding in operated OA subjects from the full release of UK Biobank (17 894 cases and 89 470 controls). We investigated its functional implications in methylation, gene expression and proteomics data in primary chondrocytes from 12 pairs of intact and degraded cartilage samples from patients undergoing TJR. We detect a genome-wide significant association at rs10116772 with TJR (P=3.7×10(-8); for allele A: OR (95% CI) 0.97 (0.96 to 0.98)), an intronic variant in(GLIS3), which is expressed in cartilage. Variants in strong correlation with rs10116772 have been associated with elevated plasma glucose levels and diabetes. We identify a novel susceptibility locus for OA that has been previously implicated in diabetes and glycaemic traits.	
29432556	A High-risk Haplotype for Premature Menopause in Childhood Cancer Survivors Exposed to Gonadotoxic Therapy.	Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk of therapy-related premature menopause (PM), with a cumulative incidence of 8.0%, but the contribution of genetic factors is unknown. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with clinically diagnosed PM (menopause < 40 years) among 799 female survivors of childhood cancer participating in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE). Analyses were adjusted for cyclophosphamide equivalent dose of alkylating agents and ovarian radiotherapy (RT) dose (all P values two-sided). Replication was performed using self-reported PM in 1624 survivors participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). PM was clinically diagnosed in 30 (3.8%) SJLIFE participants. Thirteen SNPs (70 kb region of chromosome 4q32.1) upstream of the Neuropeptide Receptor 2 gene (NPY2R) were associated with PM prevalence (minimum P = 3.3 × 10-7 for rs9999820, all P < 10-5). Being a homozygous carrier of a haplotype formed by four of the 13 SNPs (seen in one in seven in the general population but more than 50% of SJLIFE clinically diagnosed PM) was associated with markedly elevated PM prevalence among survivors exposed to ovarian RT (odds ratio [OR] = 25.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.18 to 138.31, P = 8.2 × 10-6); this finding was replicated in an independent second cohort of CCSS in spite of its use of self-reported PM (OR = 3.97, 95% CI = 1.67 to 9.41, P = .002). Evidence from bioinformatics data suggests that the haplotype alters the regulation of NPY2R transcription, possibly affecting PM risk through neuroendocrine pathways. The haplotype captures the majority of clinically diagnosed PM cases and, with further validation, may have clinical application in identifying the highest-risk survivors for PM for possible intervention by cryopreservation.	
29422604	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies five new susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer.	In 2020, 146,063 deaths due to pancreatic cancer are estimated to occur in Europe and the United States combined. To identify common susceptibility alleles, we performed the largest pancreatic cancer GWAS to date, including 9040 patients and 12,496 controls of European ancestry from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Here, we find significant evidence of a novel association at rs78417682 (7p12/TNS3, P = 4.35 × 10(-8)). Replication of 10 promising signals in up to 2737 patients and 4752 controls from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium yields new genome-wide significant loci: rs13303010 at 1p36.33 (NOC2L, P = 8.36 × 10(-14)), rs2941471 at 8q21.11 (HNF4G, P = 6.60 × 10(-10)), rs4795218 at 17q12 (HNF1B, P = 1.32 × 10(-8)), and rs1517037 at 18q21.32 (GRP, P = 3.28 × 10(-8)). rs78417682 is not statistically significantly associated with pancreatic cancer in PANDoRA. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in three independent pancreatic data sets provides molecular support of NOC2L as a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene.	
29452408	Genome-wide association study identifies seven novel susceptibility loci for primary open-angle glaucoma.	Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide for which 15 disease-associated loci had been discovered. Among them, only 5 loci have been associated with POAG in Asians. We carried out a genome-wide association study and a replication study that included a total of 7378 POAG cases and 36 385 controls from a Japanese population. After combining the genome-wide association study and the two replication sets, we identified 11 POAG-associated loci, including 4 known (CDKN2B-AS1, ABCA1, SIX6 and AFAP1) and 7 novel loci (FNDC3B, ANKRD55-MAP3K1, LMX1B, LHPP, HMGA2, MEIS2 and LOXL1) at a genome-wide significance level (P < 5.0×10-8), bringing the total number of POAG-susceptibility loci to 22. The 7 novel variants were subsequently evaluated in a multiethnic population comprising non-Japanese East Asians (1008 cases, 591 controls), Europeans (5008 cases, 35 472 controls) and Africans (2341 cases, 2037 controls). The candidate genes located within the new loci were related to ocular development (LMX1B, HMGA2 and MAP3K1) and glaucoma-related phenotypes (FNDC3B, LMX1B and LOXL1). Pathway analysis suggested epidermal growth factor receptor signaling might be involved in POAG pathogenesis. Genetic correlation analysis revealed the relationships between POAG and systemic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. These results improve our understanding of the genetic factors that affect the risk of developing POAG and provide new insight into the genetic architecture of POAG in Asians.	
29455858	A Large-Scale Multi-ancestry Genome-wide Study Accounting for Smoking Behavior Identifies Multiple Significant Loci for Blood Pressure.	Genome-wide association analysis advanced understanding of blood pressure (BP), a major risk factor for vascular conditions such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Accounting for smoking behavior may help identify BP loci and extend our knowledge of its genetic architecture. We performed genome-wide association meta-analyses of systolic and diastolic BP incorporating gene-smoking interactions in 610,091 individuals. Stage 1 analysis examined ∼18.8 million SNPs and small insertion/deletion variants in 129,913 individuals from four ancestries (European, African, Asian, and Hispanic) with follow-up analysis of promising variants in 480,178 additional individuals from five ancestries. We identified 15 loci that were genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10(-8)) in stage 1 and formally replicated in stage 2. A combined stage 1 and 2 meta-analysis identified 66 additional genome-wide significant loci (13, 35, and 18 loci in European, African, and trans-ancestry, respectively). A total of 56 known BP loci were also identified by our results (p < 5 × 10(-8)). Of the newly identified loci, ten showed significant interaction with smoking status, but none of them were replicated in stage 2. Several loci were identified in African ancestry, highlighting the importance of genetic studies in diverse populations. The identified loci show strong evidence for regulatory features and support shared pathophysiology with cardiometabolic and addiction traits. They also highlight a role in BP regulation for biological candidates such as modulators of vascular structure and function (CDKN1B, BCAR1-CFDP1, PXDN, EEA1), ciliopathies (SDCCAG8, RPGRIP1L), telomere maintenance (TNKS, PINX1, AKTIP), and central dopaminergic signaling (MSRA, EBF2).	
29449654	Analysis combining correlated glaucoma traits identifies five new risk loci for open-angle glaucoma.	Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is a major cause of blindness worldwide. To identify new risk loci for OAG, we performed a genome-wide association study in 3,071 OAG cases and 6,750 unscreened controls, and meta-analysed the results with GWAS data for intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic disc parameters (the overall meta-analysis sample size varying between 32,000 to 48,000 participants), which are glaucoma-related traits. We identified and independently validated four novel genome-wide significant associations within or near MYOF and CYP26A1, LINC02052 and CRYGS, LMX1B, and LMO7 using single variant tests, one additional locus (C9) using gene-based tests, and two genetic pathways - "response to fluid shear stress" and "abnormal retina morphology" - in pathway-based tests. Interestingly, some of the new risk loci contribute to risk of other genetically-correlated eye diseases including myopia and age-related macular degeneration. To our knowledge, this study is the first integrative study to combine genetic data from OAG and its correlated traits to identify new risk variants and genetic pathways, highlighting the future potential of combining genetic data from genetically-correlated eye traits for the purpose of gene discovery and mapping.	
29246937	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a New Locus at 7q21.13 Associated with Hepatitis B Virus-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	(Purpose:) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. In China, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the major risk factor for HCC. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) among Chinese populations to identify novel genetic loci contributing to susceptibility to HBV-related HCC.(Experimental Design:) GWAS scan is performed in a collection of 205 HBV-related HCC trios (each trio includes an affected proband and his/her both parents), and 355 chronic HBV carriers with HCC (cases) and 360 chronic HBV carriers without HCC (controls), followed by two rounds of replication studies totally consisting of 3,796 cases and 2,544 controls.(Results:) We identified a novel association signal within the(CDK14) gene at 7q21.13 (index rs10272859, OR = 1.28,(P) = 9.46 × 10(-10)). Furthermore, we observed that the at-risk rs10272859[G] allele was significantly associated with higher mRNA expression levels of(CDK14) in liver tissues. Chromosome conformation capture assays in liver cells confirmed that a physical interaction exists between the promoter region of(CDK14) and the risk-associated SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with the index rs10272859 at 7q21.13. This index rs10272859 also showed significant association with the survival of HCC patients.(Conclusions:) Our findings highlight a novel locus at 7q21.13 conferring both susceptibility and prognosis to HBV-related HCC, and suggest the(CDK14) gene to be the functional target of the 7q21.13 locus.(Clin Cancer Res; 24(4); 906-15. ©2017 AACR).	
29453348	ABCG2 contributes to the development of gout and hyperuricemia in a genome-wide association study.	Although many genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of hyperuricemia or gout have been reported, the related genetic factors and the mechanisms from hyperuricemia to gouty attack remain unclear. This study aimed to identify genetic factors and pathogenesis of gout from hyperuricemia by genome-wide association study (GWAS). 747 gout patients, 747 hyperuricemia and 2071 age-matched controls were recruited and analyzed with Affymetrix 650 K chip to find the related genetic variants. The functions of the related genes were investigated in an endothelial cell (EC) with urate crystal stimulation. The GWAS results showed 36 SNPs to be strongly associated with gout compared to controls (all p-values < 10(-7)). Whereas the rs2231142 in ABCG2 gene had significant associations between gout and controls, between gout and hyperuricemia, and between hyperuricemia and controls (all p-values < 10(-7)), and the ORs were 4.34, 3.37 and 2.15 (all p-values < 0.001) after adjustment of potential confounders, respectively. The cell model showed significantly higher IL-8 release from EC combined with ABCG2 knockdown. We concluded that ABCG2 gene contributed to hyperuricemia but also gout, and that it was involved in the inflammation dysregulation via augmented IL-8 release in EC.	
29453196	Genome-wide association study identifies 	The decrease in sperm motility has a potent influence on fertilisation. Sperm motility, represented as the percentage of motile sperm in ejaculated sperms, is influenced by lifestyle habits or environmental factors and by inherited factors. However, genetic factors contributing to individual differences in sperm motility remain unclear. To identify genetic factors that influence human sperm motility, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of sperm motility. A two-stage GWAS was conducted using 811 Japanese men in a discovery stage, followed by a replication study using an additional 779 Japanese men. In the two-staged GWAS, a single nucleotide polymorphism rs3791686 in the intron of gene for erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 ((ERBB4)) on chromosome 2q34 was identified as a novel locus for sperm motility, as evident from the discovery and replication results using meta-analysis (β=-4.01, combined P=5.40×10(-9)). Together with the previous evidence that Sertoli cell-specific(Erbb4)-knockout mice display an impaired ability to produce motile sperm, this finding provides the first genetic evidence for further investigation of the genome-wide significant association at the(ERBB4) locus in larger studies across diverse human populations.	
29471430	GWAS identifies two novel colorectal cancer loci at 16q24.1 and 20q13.12.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified more than 50 CRC loci. However, most of the previous studies were conducted in European population, and host genetic factors among Japanese population are largely remained to be identified. To identify novel loci in the Japanese population, here, we performed a large-scale GWAS using 6692 cases and 27 178 controls followed by a replication analysis using more than 11 000 case-control samples. We found the significant association of 10 loci (P < 5 × 10-8), including 2 novel loci on 16q24.1 (IRF8-FOXF1, rs847208, P = 3.15 × 10-9 and odds ratio = 1.107 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.071-1.145) and 20q13.12 (TOX2, rs6065668, P = 4.47 × 10-11 and odds ratio = 0.897 with 95% CI of 0.868-0.926). Moreover, 35 previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 24 regions were validated in the Japanese population (P < 0.05) with the same risk allele as in the previous studies. SNP rs6065668 was significantly associated with TOX2 expression in the sigmoid colon. In addition, nucleotide substitutions in the regulatory region of TOX2 were predicted to alter the binding of several transcription factors, including KLF5. Our findings elucidate the important role of genetic variations in the development of CRC in the Japanese population.	
29460428	Genomewide Association Study of Alcohol Dependence and Related Traits in a Thai Population.	Alcohol use (both quantity and dependence) is moderately heritable, and genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified risk genes in European, African, and Asian populations. The most reproducibly identified risk genes affect alcohol metabolism. Well-known functional variants at the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase B and other alcohol dehydrogenases affect risk in European and African ancestry populations. Similarly, variants mapped to these same genes and a well-known null variant that maps to the gene that encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) also affect risk in various Asian populations. In this study, we completed the first GWAS for 3 traits related to alcohol use in a Thai population recruited initially for studies of methamphetamine dependence. All subjects were evaluated with the Thai version of the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA). A total of 1,045 subjects were available for analysis. Three traits were analyzed: flushing, maximum number of alcoholic beverages consumed in any lifetime 24-hour period ("MAXDRINKS"), and DSM-IV alcohol dependence criterion count. We also conducted a pleiotropy analysis with major depression, the only other psychiatric trait where summary statistics from a large-scale Asian-population GWAS are available. All 3 traits showed genomewide significant association with variants near ALDH2, with significance ranging from 2.01 × 10(-14) (for flushing; lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) PTPN11* rs143894582) to p(meta)  = 5.80 × 10(-10) (for alcohol dependence criterion count; lead SNP rs149212747). These lead SNPs flank rs671 and span a region of over a megabase, illustrating the need for prior biological information in identifying the actual effect SNP, rs671. We also identified significant pleiotropy between major depression and flushing. These results are consistent with prior findings in Asian populations and add new information regarding alcohol use-depression pleiotropy.	
29458411	Genome-wide pleiotropy analysis of neuropathological traits related to Alzheimer's disease.	Simultaneous consideration of two neuropathological traits related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been attempted in a genome-wide association study. We conducted genome-wide pleiotropy analyses using association summary statistics from the Beecham et al. study (PLoS Genet 10:e1004606, 2014) for AD-related neuropathological traits, including neuritic plaque (NP), neurofibrillary tangle (NFT), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Significant findings were further examined by expression quantitative trait locus and differentially expressed gene analyses in AD vs. control brains using gene expression data. Genome-wide significant pleiotropic associations were observed for the joint model of NP and NFT (NP + NFT) with the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs34487851 upstream of C2orf40 (alias ECRG4, P = 2.4 × 10(-8)) and for the joint model of NFT and CAA (NFT + CAA) with the HDAC9 SNP rs79524815 (P = 1.1 × 10(-8)). Gene-based testing revealed study-wide significant associations (P ≤ 2.0 × 10(-6)) for the NFT + CAA outcome with adjacent genes TRAPPC12, TRAPPC12-AS1, and ADI1. Risk alleles of proxy SNPs for rs79524815 were associated with significantly lower expression of HDAC9 in the brain (P = 3.0 × 10(-3)), and HDAC9 was significantly downregulated in subjects with AD compared with control subjects in the prefrontal (P = 7.9 × 10(-3)) and visual (P = 5.6 × 10(-4)) cortices. Our findings suggest that pleiotropy analysis is a useful approach to identifying novel genetic associations with complex diseases and their endophenotypes. Functional studies are needed to determine whether ECRG4 or HDAC9 is plausible as a therapeutic target.	
29496196	Genome-wide Association Study of Dimensional Psychopathology Using Electronic Health Records.	Genetic studies of neuropsychiatric disease strongly suggest an overlap in liability. There are growing efforts to characterize these diseases dimensionally rather than categorically, but the extent to which such dimensional models correspond to biology is unknown. We applied a newly developed natural language processing method to extract five symptom dimensions based on the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria definitions from narrative hospital discharge notes in a large biobank. We conducted a genome-wide association study to examine whether common variants were associated with each of these dimensions as quantitative traits. Among 4687 individuals, loci in three of five domains exceeded a genome-wide threshold for statistical significance. These included a locus spanning the neocortical development genes RFPL3 and RFPL3S for arousal (p = 2.29 × 10(-8)) and one spanning the FPR3 gene for cognition (p = 3.22 × 10(-8)). Natural language processing identifies dimensional phenotypes that may facilitate the discovery of common genetic variation that is relevant to psychopathology.	
29472232	Genome-Wide Association and Functional Studies Identify 	The genetic contribution to coronary artery disease (CAD) remains largely unclear. We combined genetic screening with functional characterizations to identify novel loci and candidate genes for CAD. We performed genome-wide screening followed by multicenter validation in 8 cohorts consisting of 21 828 participants of Han ethnicity and identified 3 novel intragenic SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), rs9486729 ((SCML4) [Scm polycomb group protein-like 4]; odds ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17-1.34;(P)=3.51×10(-11)), rs17165136 ((THSD7A) [thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing 7A]; odds ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.21-1.35;(P)<1.00×10(-25)), and rs852787 ((DAB1) [disabled-1]; odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.21-1.38;(P)=2.02×10(-14)), associated with CAD with genome-wide significance. The risk allele of rs9486729 and protective allele of rs17165136 were associated with the decreased expression of their host genes,(SCML4) and(THSD7A), respectively, whereas rs852787 did not have transcriptional effects on any gene. Knockdown of(SCML4) activated endothelial cells by increasing the expression of(IL-6),(E-selectin), and(ICAM) and weakened their antiapoptotic activity, whereas the knockdown of(THSD7A) had little effect on these endothelial cell functions but attenuated monocyte adhesion via decreasing the expression of(ICAM),(L-selectin), and(ITGB2). We further showed that inhibiting the expression of(SCML4) exacerbated endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling in a rat model with partial carotid ligation. We identify 3 novel loci associated with CAD and show that 2 genes,(SCML4) and(THSD7A), make functional contributions to atherosclerosis. How rs852787 and its host gene(DAB1) are linked to CAD needs further studies.	
29472613	Genetic contribution to 'theory of mind' in adolescence.	Difficulties in 'theory of mind' (the ability to attribute mental states to oneself or others, and to make predictions about another's behaviour based on these attributions) have been observed in several psychiatric conditions. We investigate the genetic architecture of theory of mind in 4,577 13-year-olds who completed the Emotional Triangles Task (Triangles Task), a first-order test of theory of mind. We observe a small but significant female-advantage on the Triangles Task (Cohen's d = 0.19, P < 0.01), in keeping with previous work using other tests of theory of mind. Genome-wide association analyses did not identify any significant loci, and SNP heritability was non-significant. Polygenic scores for six psychiatric conditions (ADHD, anorexia, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia), and empathy were not associated with scores on the Triangles Task. However, polygenic scores of cognitive aptitude, and cognitive empathy, a term synonymous with theory of mind and measured using the "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" Test, were significantly associated with scores on the Triangles Task at multiple P-value thresholds, suggesting shared genetics between different measures of theory of mind and cognition.	
29478026	Genome-Wide Association Approach Identified Novel Genetic Predictors of Heart Rate Response to β-Blockers.	For many indications, the negative chronotropic effect of β-blockers is important to their efficacy, yet the heart rate (HR) response to β-blockers varies. Herein, we sought to use a genome-wide association approach to identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with HR response to β-blockers. We first performed 4 genome-wide association analyses for HR response to atenolol (a β1-adrenergic receptor blocker) as: (1) monotherapy or (2) add-on therapy, in 426 whites and 273 blacks separately from the PEAR (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses) study. A meta-analysis was then performed between the genome-wide association analysis performed in PEAR atenolol monotherapy and add-on therapy, in each race separately, using the inverse variance method assuming fixed effects. From this analysis, SNPs associated with HR response to atenolol at a(P)<1E-05 were tested for replication in whites (n=200) and blacks (n=168) treated with metoprolol (a β1-adrenergic receptor blocker). From the genome-wide association meta-analyses, SNP rs17117817 near olfactory receptor family10 subfamily-p-member1 ((OR10P1)), and SNP rs2364349 in sorting nexin-9 ((SNX9)) replicated in blacks. The combined studies meta-analysis(P) values for the rs17117817 and rs2364349 reached genome-wide significance (rs17117817G-allele; Meta-β=5.53 beats per minute, Meta-(P)=2E-09 and rs2364349 A-allele; Meta-β=3.5 beats per minute, Meta-(P)=1E-08). Additionally, SNPs in the(OR10P1) and(SNX9) gene regions were also associated with HR response in whites. This study highlights(OR10P1) and(SNX9) as novel genes associated with changes in HR in response to β-blockers. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00246519.	
29535710	Genome-Wide Association Study on Immunoglobulin G Glycosylation Patterns.	Immunoglobulin G (IgG), a glycoprotein secreted by plasma B-cells, plays a major role in the human adaptive immune response and are associated with a wide range of diseases. Glycosylation of the Fc binding region of IgGs, responsible for the antibody's effector function, is essential for prompting a proper immune response. This study focuses on the general genetic impact on IgG glycosylation as well as corresponding subclass specificities. To identify genetic loci involved in IgG glycosylation, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS)-measured IgG glycopeptides of 1,823 individuals in the Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region (KORA F4) study cohort. In addition, we performed GWAS on subclass-specific ratios of IgG glycans to gain power in identifying genetic factors underlying single enzymatic steps in the glycosylation pathways. We replicated our findings in 1,836 individuals from the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS). We were able to show subclass-specific genetic influences on single IgG glycan structures. The replicated results indicate that, in addition to genes encoding for glycosyltransferases (i.e.,(ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8), and(MGAT3)), other genetic loci have strong influences on the IgG glycosylation patterns. A novel locus on chromosome 1, harboring(RUNX3), which encodes for a transcription factor of the runt domain-containing family, is associated with decreased galactosylation. Interestingly, members of the(RUNX) family are cross-regulated, and(RUNX3) is involved in both IgA class switching and B-cell maturation as well as T-cell differentiation and apoptosis. Besides the involvement of glycosyltransferases in IgG glycosylation, we suggest that, due to the impact of variants within(RUNX3), potentially mechanisms involved in B-cell activation and T-cell differentiation during the immune response as well as cell migration and invasion involve IgG glycosylation.	
29495422	A Genome-Wide Association Study of Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy in African Americans.	Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) is the most common form of non-ischemic chronic heart failure. Despite the higher prevalence of IDC in African Americans, the genetics of IDC have been relatively understudied in this ethnic group. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify susceptibility genes for IDC in African Americans recruited from five sites in the U.S. (662 unrelated cases and 1167 controls). The heritability of IDC was calculated to be 33% (95% confidence interval: 19-47%;(p) = 6.4 × 10(-7)). We detected association of a variant in a novel intronic locus in the(CACNB4) gene meeting genome-wide levels of significance ((p) = 4.1 × 10(-8)). The(CACNB4) gene encodes a calcium channel subunit expressed in the heart that is important for cardiac muscle contraction. This variant has not previously been associated with IDC in any racial group. Pathway analysis, based on the 1000 genes most strongly associated with IDC, showed an enrichment for genes related to calcium signaling, growth factor signaling, neuronal/neuromuscular signaling, and various types of cellular level signaling, including gap junction and cAMP signaling. Our results suggest a novel locus for IDC in African Americans and provide additional insights into the genetic architecture and etiology.	
29535761	A Genome-Wide Search for Gene-Environment Effects in Isolated Cleft Lip with or without Cleft Palate Triads Points to an Interaction between Maternal Periconceptional Vitamin Use and Variants in 	(Background:) It is widely accepted that cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) results from the complex interplay between multiple genetic and environmental factors. However, a robust investigation of these gene-environment (GxE) interactions at a genome-wide level is still lacking for isolated CL/P.(Materials and Methods:) We used our R-package Haplin to perform a genome-wide search for GxE effects in isolated CL/P. From a previously published GWAS, genotypes and information on maternal periconceptional cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and vitamin use were available on 1908 isolated CL/P triads of predominantly European or Asian ancestry. A GxE effect is present if the relative risk estimates for gene-effects in the offspring are different across exposure strata. We tested this using the relative risk ratio (RRR). Besides analyzing all ethnicities combined ("pooled analysis"), separate analyses were conducted on Europeans and Asians to investigate ethnicity-specific effects. To control for multiple testing,(q)-values were calculated from the(p)-values.(Results:) We identified significant GxVitamin interactions with three SNPs in "Estrogen-related receptor gamma" ((ESRRG)) in the pooled analysis. The RRRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.56 (0.45-0.69) with rs1339221 ((q) = 0.011), 0.57 (0.46-0.70) with rs11117745 ((q) = 0.011), and 0.62 (0.50-0.76) with rs2099557 ((q) = 0.037). The associations were stronger when these SNPs were analyzed as haplotypes composed of two-SNP and three-SNP combinations. The strongest effect was with the "t-t-t" haplotype of the rs1339221-rs11117745-rs2099557 combination [RRR = 0.50 (0.40-0.64)], suggesting that the effects observed with the other SNP combinations, including those in the single-SNP analyses, were mainly driven by this haplotype. Although there were potential GxVitamin effects with rs17734557 and rs1316471 and GxAlcohol effects with rs9653456 and rs921876 in the European sample, respectively, none of the SNPs was located in or near genes with strong links to orofacial clefts. GxAlcohol and GxSmoke effects were not assessed in the Asian sample because of a lack of observations for these exposures.(Discussion/Conclusion:) We identified significant interactions between vitamin use and variants in(ESRRG) in the pooled analysis. These GxE effects are novel and warrant further investigations to elucidate their roles in orofacial clefting. If validated, they could provide prospects for exploring the impact of estrogens and vitamins on clefting, with potential translational applications.	
29483656	Common schizophrenia alleles are enriched in mutation-intolerant genes and in regions under strong background selection.	Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric condition often associated with poor quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Lack of progress in improving treatment outcomes has been attributed to limited knowledge of the underlying biology, although large-scale genomic studies have begun to provide insights. We report a new genome-wide association study of schizophrenia (11,260 cases and 24,542 controls), and through meta-analysis with existing data we identify 50 novel associated loci and 145 loci in total. Through integrating genomic fine-mapping with brain expression and chromosome conformation data, we identify candidate causal genes within 33 loci. We also show for the first time that the common variant association signal is highly enriched among genes that are under strong selective pressures. These findings provide new insights into the biology and genetic architecture of schizophrenia, highlight the importance of mutation-intolerant genes and suggest a mechanism by which common risk variants persist in the population.	
29499414	Joint study of two genome-wide association meta-analyses identified 20p12.1 and 20q13.33 for bone mineral density.	In the present study, aiming to identify loci associated with osteoporosis, we conducted a joint association study of 2 independent genome-wide association meta-analyses of femoral neck and lumbar spine bone mineral densities (BMDs): 1) an in-house study of 6 samples involving 7484 subjects, and 2) the GEFOS-seq study of 7 samples involving 32,965 subjects. The in-house samples were imputed by the 1000 genomes project phase 3 reference panel. SNP-based association test was applied to 7,998,108 autosomal SNPs in each meta-analysis, and for each SNP the 2 association signals were then combined for joint analysis and for mutual replication. Combining the evidence from both studies, we identified 2 novel loci associated with BMDs at the genome-wide significance level (α=5.0×10(-8)): 20p12.1 (rs73100693 p=2.65×10(-8), closest gene MACROD2) and 20q13.33 (rs2380128 p=3.44×10(-8), OSBPL2). We also replicated 7 loci that were reported by two recent studies on heel and total body BMD. Our findings provide useful insights that enhance our understanding of bone development, osteoporosis and fracture pathogenesis.	
29535370	Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of human host factors influencing viral severity of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).	Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is an incurable viral infection with severity ranging from asymptomatic to frequent recurrences. The viral shedding rate has been shown as a reproducible HSV-2 severity end point that correlates with lesion rates. We used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the role of common human genetic variation in HSV-2 severity. We performed a GWAS on 223 HSV-2-positive participants of European ancestry. Severity was measured by viral shedding rate, as defined by the percent of days PCR+ for HSV-2 DNA over at least 30 days. Analyses were performed under linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and ancestry. There were no genome-wide significant (p < 5E-08) associations with HSV-2 viral shedding rate. The top nonsignificant SNP (rs75932292, p = 6.77E-08) associated with HSV-2 viral shedding was intergenic, with the nearest known biologically interesting gene (ABCA1) ~130 kbp downstream. Several other SNPs approaching significance were in or near genes with viral or neurological associations, including four SNPs in KIF1B. The current study is the first comprehensive genome-wide investigation of human genetic variation in virologic severity of established HSV-2 infection. However, no significant associations were observed with HSV-2 virologic severity, leaving the exact role of human variation in HSV-2 severity unclear.	
29489655	Genome-wide association study of maternal genetic effects and parent-of-origin effects on food allergy.	Previous genetic studies of food allergy (FA) have mainly focused on inherited genotypic effects. The role of parental genotypic effects remains largely unexplored. Leveraging existing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data generated from the Chicago Food Allergy Study, we examined maternal genotypic and parent-of-origin (PO) effects using multinomial likelihood ratio tests in 588 complete and incomplete Caucasian FA trios. We identified 1 single nucleotide polymorphism with significant (P < 5×10) maternal effect on any FA (rs4235235), which is located in a noncoding RNA (LOC101927947) with unknown function. We also identified 3 suggestive (P < 5×10) loci with maternal genetic effects: 1 for any FA (rs976078, in a gene desert region on 13q31.1) and 2 for egg allergy (rs1343795 and rs4572450, in the ZNF652 gene, where genetic variants have been associated with atopic dermatitis). Three suggestive loci with PO effect were observed: 1 for peanut allergy (rs4896888 in the ADGB gene) and 2 for any FA in boys only (rs1036504 and rs2917750 in the IQCE gene). Findings from this family-based GWAS of FA provided some preliminary evidence on maternal genotypic or PO effects on FA. Additional family-based studies are needed to confirm our findings and gain new insight into maternal and paternal genetic contribution to FA.	
29545823	Genome-Wide Association Study of Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D in US Women.	Genetic factors likely influence individuals' concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a biomarker of vitamin D exposure previously linked to reduced risk of several chronic diseases. We conducted a genome-wide association study of serum 25(OH)D (assessed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) and 386,449 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our sample consisted of 1,829 participants randomly selected from the Sister Study, a cohort of women who had a sister with breast cancer but had never had breast cancer themselves. 19,741 SNPs were associated with 25(OH)D ((p) < 0.05). We re-assessed these hits in an independent sample of 1,534 participants who later developed breast cancer. After pooling, 32 SNPs had genome-wide significant associations ((p) < 5 × 10(-8)). These were located in or near(GC), the vitamin D binding protein, or(CYP2R1), a cytochrome P450 enzyme that hydroxylates vitamin D to form 25(OH)D. The top hit was rs4588, a missense(GC) polymorphism associated with a 3.5 ng/mL decrease in 25(OH)D per copy of the minor allele (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.1, -3.0;(p) = 4.5 × 10(-38)). The strongest SNP near(CYP2R1) was rs12794714, a synonymous variant ((p) = 3.8 × 10(-12); β = 1.8 ng/mL decrease in 25(OH)D per minor allele [CI: -2.2, -1.3]). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations from samples collected from some participants 3-10 years after baseline (811 cases, 780 non-cases) were also strongly associated with both loci. These findings augment our understanding of genetic influences on 25(OH)D and the possible role of vitamin D binding proteins and cytochrome P450 enzymes in determining measured levels. These results may help to identify individuals genetically predisposed to vitamin D insufficiency.	
29615537	Strong impact of natural-selection-free heterogeneity in genetics of age-related phenotypes.	A conceptual difficulty in genetics of age-related phenotypes that make individuals vulnerable to disease in post-reproductive life is genetic heterogeneity attributed to an undefined role of evolution in establishing their molecular mechanisms. Here, we performed univariate and pleiotropic genome-wide meta-analyses of 20 age-related phenotypes leveraging longitudinal information in a sample of 33,431 individuals and dealing with the natural-selection-free genetic heterogeneity. We identified 142 non-proxy single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with phenotype-specific (18 SNPs) and pleiotropic (124 SNPs) associations at genome-wide level. Univariate meta-analysis identified two novel (11.1%) and replicated 16 SNPs whereas pleiotropic meta-analysis identified 115 novel (92.7%) and nine replicated SNPs. Pleiotropic associations for most novel (93.9%) and all replicated SNPs were strongly impacted by the natural-selection-free genetic heterogeneity in its unconventional form of antagonistic heterogeneity, implying antagonistic directions of genetic effects for directly correlated phenotypes. Our results show that the common genome-wide approach is well adapted to handle homogeneous univariate associations within Mendelian framework whereas most associations with age-related phenotypes are more complex and well beyond that framework. Dissecting the natural-selection-free genetic heterogeneity is critical for gaining insights into genetics of age-related phenotypes and has substantial and unexplored yet potential for improving efficiency of genome-wide analysis.	
29503163	Five novel loci associated with antipsychotic treatment response in patients with schizophrenia: a genome-wide association study.	Antipsychotic drugs improve schizophrenia symptoms and reduce the frequency of relapse, but treatment response is highly variable. Little is known about the genetic factors associated with treatment response. We did a genome-wide association study of antipsychotic treatment response in patients with schizophrenia. The discovery cohort comprised patients with schizophrenia from 32 psychiatric hospitals in China that are part of the Chinese Antipsychotics Pharmacogenomics Consortium. Patients who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to six groups (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and haloperidol or perphenazine; those assigned to haloperidol or perphenazine were subsequently assigned [1:1] to one or the other) for 6 weeks. Antipsychotic response was quantified with percentage change on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for their association with treatment response. Linkage-disequilibrium-independent SNPs that exhibited potential associations (ie, p<1 × 10(-5)) were tested in a validation cohort comprising patients from the Chinese Antipsychotics Pharmacogenetics Consortium from five collaborative hospitals, who were treated with olanzapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole for 8 weeks. The discovery cohort contained 2413 patients and the validation cohort 1379 patients. In the discovery cohort, we identified three novel SNPs (rs72790443 in MEGF10 [p=1·37 × 10(-8)], rs1471786 in SLC1A1 [p=1·77 × 10(-8)], and rs9291547 in PCDH7 [p=4·48 × 10(-8)]) that were associated with antipsychotic treatment response at a genome-wide significance level. These associations were confirmed in the validation cohort (p<0·05). In the combined sample of the discovery and validation cohorts, we identified five novel loci showing genome-wide significant associations with general antipsychotic treatment response (rs72790443 in MEGF10 [p=1·40 × 10(-9)], rs1471786 in SLC1A1 [p=2·33 × 10(-9)], rs9291547 in PCDH7 [p=3·24 × 10(-9)], rs12711680 in CNTNAP5 [p=2·12 × 10(-8)], and rs6444970 in TNIK [p=4·85 × 10(-8)]). In antipsychotic-specific groups, after the combination of results from both samples, the rs2239063 SNP in CACNA1C was associated with treatment response to olanzapine (p=1·10 × 10(-8)), rs16921385 in SLC1A1 was associated with treatment response to risperidone (p=4·40 × 10(-8)), and rs17022006 in CNTN4 was associated with treatment response to aripiprazole (p=2·58 × 10(-8)). We have identified genes related to synaptic function, neurotransmitter receptors, and schizophrenia risk that are associated with response to antipsychotics. These findings improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying treatment responses, and the identified biomarkers could eventually guide choice of antipsychotic in patients with schizophrenia.

29562276	Enhanced Contribution of HLA in Pediatric Onset Ulcerative Colitis.	The genetic contributions to pediatric onset ulcerative colitis (UC), characterized by severe disease and extensive colonic involvement, are largely unknown. In adult onset UC, Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) has identified numerous loci, most of which have a modest susceptibility risk (OR 0.84-1.14), with the exception of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on Chromosome 6 (OR 3.59). To study the genetic contribution to exclusive pediatric onset UC, a GWAS was performed on 466 cases with 2099 healthy controls using UK Biobank array. SNP2HLA was used to impute classical HLA alleles and their corresponding amino acids, and the results are compared with adult onset UC. HLA explained the almost entire association signal, dominated with 191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (p = 5 x 10-8 to 5 x 10-10). Although very small effects, established SNPs in adult onset UC loci had similar direction and magnitude in pediatric onset UC. SNP2HLA imputation identified HLA-DRB1*0103 (odds ratio [OR] = 6.941, p = 1.92*10-13) as the most significant association for pediatric UC compared with adult onset UC (OR = 3.59). Further conditioning showed independent effects for HLA-DRB1*1301 (OR = 2.25, p = 7.92*10-9) and another SNP rs17188113 (OR = 0.48, p = 7.56*10-9). Two HLA-DRB1 causal alleles are shared with adult onset UC, while at least 2 signals are unique to pediatric UC. Subsequent stratified analyses indicated that HLA-DRB1*0103 has stronger association for extensive disease (E4: OR = 8.28, p = 4.66x10-10) and female gender (OR = 8.85, p = 4.82x10-13). In pediatric onset UC, the HLA explains almost the entire genetic associations. In addition, the HLA association is approximately twice as strong in pediatric UC compared with adults, due to a combination of novel and shared effects. We speculate the paramount importance of antigenic stimulation either by infectious or noninfectious stimuli as a causal event in pediatric UC onset.	
29497042	Genetic study links components of the autonomous nervous system to heart-rate profile during exercise.	Heart rate (HR) responds to exercise by increasing during exercise and recovering after exercise. As such, HR is an important predictor of mortality that researchers believe is modulated by the autonomic nervous system. However, the mechanistic basis underlying inter-individual differences has yet to be explained. Here, we perform a large-scale genome-wide analysis of HR increase and HR recovery in 58,818 UK Biobank individuals. Twenty-five independent SNPs in 23 loci are identified to be associated (p < 8.3 × 10(-9)) with HR increase or HR recovery. A total of 36 candidate causal genes are prioritized that are enriched for pathways related to neuron biology. No evidence is found of a causal relationship with mortality or cardiovascular diseases. However, a nominal association with parental lifespan requires further study. In conclusion, the findings provide new biological and clinical insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of HR response to exercise. The results also underscore the role of the autonomous nervous system in HR recovery.	
29521573	Effect of HLA-DRB1 alleles and genetic variants on the development of neutralizing antibodies to interferon beta in the BEYOND and BENEFIT trials.	Treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) with interferon β can lead to the development of antibodies directed against interferon β that interfere with treatment efficacy. Several observational studies have proposed different HLA alleles and genetic variants associated with the development of antibodies against interferon β. To validate the proposed genetic markers and to identify new markers. Associations of genetic candidate markers with antibody presence and development were examined in a post hoc analysis in 941 patients treated with interferon β-1b in the Betaferon(®) Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose (BEYOND) and BEtaseron(®)/BEtaferon(®) in Newly Emerging multiple sclerosis For Initial Treatment (BENEFIT) prospective phase III trials. All patients were treated with interferon β-1b for at least 6 months. In addition, a genome-wide association study was conducted to identify new genetic variants. We confirmed an increased risk for carriers of HLA-DRB1*04:01 (odds ratio (OR) = 3.3, p = 6.9 × 10(-4)) and HLA-DRB1*07:01 (OR = 1.8, p = 3.5 × 10(-3)) for developing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Several additional, previously proposed HLA alleles and genetic variants showed nominally significant associations. In the exploratory analysis, variants in the HLA region were associated with NAb development at genome-wide significance (OR = 2.6, p = 2.30 × 10(-15)). The contribution of HLA alleles and HLA-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the development and titer of antibodies against interferon β was confirmed in the combined analysis of two multi-national, multi-center studies.
29500382	Item-level analyses reveal genetic heterogeneity in neuroticism.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of psychological traits are generally conducted on (dichotomized) sums of items or symptoms (e.g., case-control status), and not on the individual items or symptoms themselves. We conduct large-scale GWAS on 12 neuroticism items and observe notable and replicable variation in genetic signal between items. Within samples, genetic correlations among the items range between 0.38 and 0.91 (mean r(g) = .63), indicating genetic heterogeneity in the full item set. Meta-analyzing the two samples, we identify 255 genome-wide significant independent genomic regions, of which 138 are item-specific. Genetic analyses and genetic correlations with 33 external traits support genetic differences between the items. Hierarchical clustering analysis identifies two genetically homogeneous item clusters denoted depressed affect and worry. We conclude that the items used to measure neuroticism are genetically heterogeneous, and that biological understanding can be gained by studying them in genetically more homogeneous clusters.	
29495898	Molecular Genetic Analysis Subdivided by Adversity Exposure Suggests Etiologic Heterogeneity in Major Depression.	The extent to which major depression is the outcome of a single biological mechanism or represents a final common pathway of multiple disease processes remains uncertain. Genetic approaches can potentially identify etiologic heterogeneity in major depression by classifying patients on the basis of their experience of major adverse events. Data are from the China, Oxford, and VCU Experimental Research on Genetic Epidemiology (CONVERGE) project, a study of Han Chinese women with recurrent major depression aimed at identifying genetic risk factors for major depression in a rigorously ascertained cohort carefully assessed for key environmental risk factors (N=9,599). To detect etiologic heterogeneity, genome-wide association studies, heritability analyses, and gene-by-environment interaction analyses were performed. Genome-wide association studies stratified by exposure to adversity revealed three novel loci associated with major depression only in study participants with no history of adversity. Significant gene-by-environment interactions were seen between adversity and genotype at all three loci, and 13.2% of major depression liability can be attributed to genome-wide interaction with adversity exposure. The genetic risk in major depression for participants who reported major adverse life events (27%) was partially shared with that in participants who did not (73%; genetic correlation=+0.64). Together with results from simulation studies, these findings suggest etiologic heterogeneity within major depression as a function of environmental exposures. The genetic contributions to major depression may differ between women with and those without major adverse life events. These results have implications for the molecular dissection of major depression and other complex psychiatric and biomedical diseases.	
29507422	A large electronic-health-record-based genome-wide study of serum lipids.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 94,674 ancestrally diverse Kaiser Permanente members using 478,866 longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-derived measurements for untreated serum lipid levels empowered multiple new findings: 121 new SNP associations (46 primary, 15 conditional, and 60 in meta-analysis with Global Lipids Genetic Consortium data); an increase of 33-42% in variance explained with multiple measurements; sex differences in genetic impact (greater impact in females for LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol and the opposite for triglycerides); differences in variance explained among non-Hispanic whites, Latinos, African Americans, and East Asians; genetic dominance and epistatic interaction, with strong evidence for both at the ABO and FUT2 genes for LDL; and tissue-specific enrichment of GWAS-associated SNPs among liver, adipose, and pancreas eQTLs. Using EHR pharmacy data, both LDL and triglyceride genetic risk scores (477 SNPs) were strongly predictive of age at initiation of lipid-lowering treatment. These findings highlight the value of longitudinal EHRs for identifying new genetic features of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism with implications for lipid treatment and risk of coronary heart disease.	
29559957	Heritability and Genome-Wide Association Analyses of Serum Uric Acid in Middle and Old-Aged Chinese Twins.	Serum uric acid (SUA), as the end product of purine metabolism, has proven emerging roles in human disorders. Here based on a sample of 379 middle and old-aged Chinese twin pairs, we aimed to explore the magnitude of genetic impact on SUA variation by performing sex-limitation twin modeling analyses and further detect specific genetic variants related to SUA by conducting a genome-wide association study. Monozygotic (MZ) twin correlation for SUA level (rMZ = 0.56) was larger than for dizygotic (DZ) twin correlation (rDZ = 0.39). The common effects sex-limitation model provided the best fit with additive genetic parameter ((A)) accounting for 46.3%, common or shared environmental parameter ((C)) accounting for 26.3% and unique/nonshared environmental parameter ((E)) accounting for 27.5% for females and 29.9, 33.1, and 37.0% for males, respectively. Although no SUA-related genetic variants reached genome-wide significance level, 25 SNPs were suggestive of association ((P) < 1 × 10(-5)). Most of the SNPs were located in an intronic region and detected to have regulatory effects on gene transcription. The cell-type specific enhancer of skeletal muscle was detected which has been reported to implicate SUA. Two promising genetic regions on chromosome 17 around rs2253277 and chromosome 14 around rs11621523 were found. Gene-based analysis found 167 genes nominally associated with SUA level ((P) < 0.05), including(PTGR2, ENTPD5), well-known(SLC2A9), etc. Enrichment analysis identified one pathway of transmembrane transport of small molecules and 20 GO gene sets involving in ion transport, transmembrane transporter activity, hydrolase activity acting on acid anhydrides, etc. In conclusion, SUA shows moderate heritability in women and low heritability in men in the Chinese population and genetic variations are significantly involved in functional genes and regulatory domains that mediate SUA level. Our findings provide clues to further elucidate molecular physiology of SUA homeostasis and identify new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for hyperuricemia and gout.	
29559929	Association of the Polygenic Scores for Personality Traits and Response to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder.	Studies reported a strong genetic correlation between the Big Five personality traits and major depressive disorder (MDD). Moreover, personality traits are thought to be associated with response to antidepressants treatment that might partly be mediated by genetic factors. In this study, we examined whether polygenic scores (PGSs) derived from the Big Five personality traits predict treatment response and remission in patients with MDD who were prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In addition, we performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on these traits to identify genetic variants underpinning the cross-trait polygenic association. The PGS analysis was performed using data from two cohorts: the Pharmacogenomics Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS,(n) = 529) and the International SSRI Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ISPC,(n) = 865). The cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses were conducted by combining GWAS summary statistics on SSRIs treatment outcome and on the personality traits. The results showed that the PGS for openness and neuroticism were associated with SSRIs treatment outcomes at(p) < 0.05 across P(T) thresholds in both cohorts. A significant association was also found between the PGS for conscientiousness and SSRIs treatment response in the PGRN-AMPS sample. In the cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses, we identified eight loci associated with (a) SSRIs response and conscientiousness near(YEATS4) gene and (b) SSRI remission and neuroticism eight loci near(PRAG1, MSRA, XKR6, ELAVL2, PLXNC1, PLEKHM1), and(BRUNOL4) genes. An assessment of a polygenic load for personality traits may assist in conjunction with clinical data to predict whether MDD patients might respond favorably to SSRIs.	
29511194	Genome-wide analysis yields new loci associating with aortic valve stenosis.	Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease, and valve replacement is the only definitive treatment. Here we report a large genome-wide association (GWA) study of 2,457 Icelandic AS cases and 349,342 controls with a follow-up in up to 4,850 cases and 451,731 controls of European ancestry. We identify two new AS loci, on chromosome 1p21 near PALMD (rs7543130; odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, P = 1.2 × 10(-22)) and on chromosome 2q22 in TEX41 (rs1830321; OR = 1.15, P = 1.8 × 10(-13)). Rs7543130 also associates with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (OR = 1.28, P = 6.6 × 10(-10)) and aortic root diameter (P = 1.30 × 10(-8)), and rs1830321 associates with BAV (OR = 1.12, P = 5.3 × 10(-3)) and coronary artery disease (OR = 1.05, P = 9.3 × 10(-5)). The results implicate both cardiac developmental abnormalities and atherosclerosis-like processes in the pathogenesis of AS. We show that several pathways are shared by CAD and AS. Causal analysis suggests that the shared risk factors of Lp(a) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol contribute substantially to the frequent co-occurence of these diseases.	
29511167	A transcriptome-wide association study identifies PALMD as a susceptibility gene for calcific aortic valve stenosis.	Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a common and life-threatening heart disease and the current treatment options cannot stop or delay its progression. A GWAS on 1009 cases and 1017 ethnically matched controls was combined with a large-scale eQTL mapping study of human aortic valve tissues (n = 233) to identify susceptibility genes for CAVS. Replication was performed in the UK Biobank, including 1391 cases and 352,195 controls. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) reveals PALMD (palmdelphin) as significantly associated with CAVS. The CAVS risk alleles and increasing disease severity are both associated with decreased mRNA expression levels of PALMD in valve tissues. The top variant identified shows a similar effect and strong association with CAVS (P = 1.53 × 10(-10)) in UK Biobank. The identification of PALMD as a susceptibility gene for CAVS provides insights into the genetic nature of this disease, opens avenues to investigate its etiology and to develop much-needed therapeutic options.	
29513936	Identification of an Amino Acid Motif in HLA-DRβ1 That Distinguishes Uveitis in Patients With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.	Uveitis is a visually debilitating disorder that affects up to 30% of children with the most common forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The disease mechanisms predisposing only a subgroup of children to uveitis are unknown. This study was undertaken to identify genetic susceptibility loci for uveitis in JIA, using a genome-wide association study in 522 children with JIA. Two cohorts of JIA patients with ophthalmologic follow-up data were genotyped. Data were then imputed using a genome-wide imputation reference panel, and an HLA-specific reference panel was used for imputing amino acids and HLA types in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). After imputation, genome-wide and MHC-specific analyses were performed, and a reverse immunology approach was utilized to model antigen presentation at 13 common HLA-DRβ1 alleles. Presence of the amino acid serine at position 11 (serine 11) in HLA-DRβ1 was associated with an increased risk of uveitis in JIA patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.60, P = 5.43 × 10(-10) ) and was specific to girls (P(females) = 7.61 × 10(-10) versus P(males) = 0.18). Serine 11 resides in the YST motif in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRβ1; all 3 amino acids in this motif are in perfect linkage disequilibrium and show identical association with disease. Quantitative prediction of binding affinity revealed that HLA-DRβ1 alleles with the YST motif could be distinguished on the basis of discernable peptide-binding preferences. These findings highlight a genetically distinct, sexually dimorphic feature of JIA with uveitis as compared to JIA without uveitis. The association could be indicative of the potential involvement of antigen presentation by HLA-DRβ1 in the development of uveitis in JIA. The results of this study may advance our progress toward improved treatments for, and possible prevention of, the sight-threatening complications of uveitis in children with JIA.	
29514873	Multiplex genomewide association analysis of breast milk fatty acid composition extends the phenotypic association and potential selection of 	Breast milk is the sole nutrition source during exclusive breastfeeding, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) are critical micronutrients in infant physical and cognitive development. There has been no prior genomewide association study of breast milk, hence our objective was to test for genetic association with breast milk FA composition. We measured the fractional composition of 26 individual FAs in breast milk samples from three cohorts totalling 1142 Bangladeshi mothers whose infants were genotyped on the Illumina MEGA chip and replicated on a custom Affymetrix 30K SNP array (n=616). Maternal genotypes were imputed using IMPUTE. After running 33 separate FA fraction phenotypes, we found that SNPs known to be associated with serum FAs in the(FADS1/2/3) region were also associated with breast milk FA composition (experiment-wise significance threshold 4.2×10(-9)). Hypothesis-neutral comparison of the 33 fractions showed that the most significant genetic association at the(FADS1/2/3) locus was with fraction of arachidonic acid (AA) at SNP rs174556, with a very large per major allele effect size of 17% higher breast milk AA level. There was no evidence of independent association at(FADS1/2/3) with any other FA or SNP after conditioning on AA and rs174556. We also found novel significant experiment-wise SNP associations with: polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) 6/PUFA3 ratio (sorting nexin(29)), eicosenoic (intergenic) and capric (component of oligomeric Golgi complex 3) acids; and six additional loci at genomewide significance (<5×10(-8)). AA is the primary FA in breast milk influenced by genetic variation at the(FADS1/2/3) locus, extending the potential phenotypes under genetic selection to include breast milk composition, thereby possibly affecting infant growth or cognition. Breast milk FA composition is influenced by maternal genetics in addition to diet and body composition.	
29518117	Nuclear receptor and VEGF pathways for gene-blood lead interactions, on bone mineral density, in Korean smokers.	Osteoporosis has a complex etiology and is considered a multifactorial polygenic disease, in which genetic determinants are modulated by hormonal, lifestyle, environmental, and nutritional factors. Therefore, investigating these multiple factors, and the interactions between them, might lead to a better understanding of osteoporosis pathogenesis, and possible therapeutic interventions. The objective of this study was to identify the relationship between three blood metals (Pb, Cd, and Al), in smoking and nonsmoking patients' sera, and prevalence of osteoporosis. In particular, we focused on gene-environment interactions of metal exposure, including a dataset obtained through genome-wide association study (GWAS). Subsequently, we conducted a pathway-based analysis, using a GWAS dataset, to elucidate how metal exposure influences susceptibility to osteoporosis. In this study, we evaluated blood metal exposures for estimating the prevalence of osteoporosis in 443 participants (aged 53.24 ± 8.29), from the Republic of Korea. Those analyses revealed a negative association between lead blood levels and bone mineral density in current smokers (p trend <0.01). By further using GWAS-based pathway analysis, we found nuclear receptor (FDR<0.05) and VEGF pathways (FDR<0.05) to be significantly upregulated by blood lead burden, with regard to the prevalence of osteoporosis, in current smokers. These findings suggest that the intracellular pathways of angiogenesis and nuclear hormonal signaling can modulate interactions between lead exposure and genetic variation, with regard to susceptibility to diminished bone mineral density. Our findings may provide new leads for understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of osteoporosis, including possible interventions.	
29520036	Genome-wide analysis of insomnia disorder.	Insomnia is a worldwide problem with substantial deleterious health effects. Twin studies have shown a heritable basis for various sleep-related traits, including insomnia, but robust genetic risk variants have just recently begun to be identified. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of soldiers in the Army Study To Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (STARRS). GWAS were carried out separately for each ancestral group (EUR, AFR, LAT) using logistic regression for each of the STARRS component studies (including 3,237 cases and 14,414 controls), and then meta-analysis was conducted across studies and ancestral groups. Heritability (SNP-based) for lifetime insomnia disorder was significant (h(2)(g) = 0.115, p = 1.78 × 10(-4) in EUR). A meta-analysis including three ancestral groups and three study cohorts revealed a genome-wide significant locus on Chr 7 (q11.22) (top SNP rs186736700, OR = 0.607, p = 4.88 × 10(-9)) and a genome-wide significant gene-based association (p = 7.61 × 10(-7)) in EUR for RFX3 on Chr 9. Polygenic risk for sleeplessness/insomnia severity in UK Biobank was significantly positively associated with likelihood of insomnia disorder in STARRS. Genetic contributions to insomnia disorder in STARRS were significantly positively correlated with major depressive disorder (r(g) = 0.44, se = 0.22, p = 0.047) and type 2 diabetes (r(g) = 0.43, se = 0.20, p = 0.037), and negatively with morningness chronotype (r(g) = -0.34, se = 0.17, p = 0.039) and subjective well being (r(g) = -0.59, se = 0.23, p = 0.009) in external datasets. Insomnia associated loci may contribute to the genetic risk underlying a range of health conditions including psychiatric disorders and metabolic disease.	
29520040	Biological annotation of genetic loci associated with intelligence in a meta-analysis of 87,740 individuals.	Variance in IQ is associated with a wide range of health outcomes, and 1% of the population are affected by intellectual disability. Despite a century of research, the fundamental neural underpinnings of intelligence remain unclear. We integrate results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of intelligence with brain tissue and single cell gene expression data to identify tissues and cell types associated with intelligence. GWAS data for IQ (N = 78,308) were meta-analyzed with a study comparing 1247 individuals with mean IQ ~170 to 8185 controls. Genes associated with intelligence implicate pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus, and midbrain embryonic GABAergic neurons. Tissue-specific analyses find the most significant enrichment for frontal cortex brain expressed genes. These results suggest specific neuronal cell types and genes may be involved in intelligence and provide new hypotheses for neuroscience experiments using model systems.	
29523850	Risk of nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteraemia in African children is modified by STAT4.	Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) is a major cause of bacteraemia in Africa. The disease typically affects HIV-infected individuals and young children, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Here we present a genome-wide association study (180 cases, 2677 controls) and replication analysis of NTS bacteraemia in Kenyan and Malawian children. We identify a locus in STAT4, rs13390936, associated with NTS bacteraemia. rs13390936 is a context-specific expression quantitative trait locus for STAT4 RNA expression, and individuals carrying the NTS-risk genotype demonstrate decreased interferon-γ (IFNγ) production in stimulated natural killer cells, and decreased circulating IFNγ concentrations during acute NTS bacteraemia. The NTS-risk allele at rs13390936 is associated with protection against a range of autoimmune diseases. These data implicate interleukin-12-dependent IFNγ-mediated immunity as a determinant of invasive NTS disease in African children, and highlight the shared genetic architecture of infectious and autoimmune disease.	
29523524	Genome Wide Association Study Identifies the 	Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are first-line medications for treating uncomplicated hypertension. However, their use has been associated with adverse metabolic events, including hyperglycemia and incident diabetes mellitus, with incompletely understood mechanisms. Our goal was to identify genomic variants associated with thiazide-like diuretic/chlorthalidone-induced glucose change. Genome-wide analysis of glucose change after treatment with chlorthalidone was performed by race among the white (n=175) and black (n=135) participants from the PEAR-2 (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses-2). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms with(P)<5×10(-8) were further prioritized using in silico analysis based on their expression quantitative trait loci function. Among blacks, an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs9943291) in the(HMGCS2) was associated with increase in glucose levels following chlorthalidone treatment (ß=12.5;(P)=4.17×10(-8)). G-allele carriers of(HMGCS2) had higher glucose levels (glucose change=+16.29 mg/dL) post chlorthalidone treatment compared with noncarriers of G allele (glucose change=+2.80 mg/dL). This association was successfully replicated in an independent replication cohort of hydrochlorothiazide-treated participants from the PEAR study (ß=5.54;(P)=0.023). A meta-analysis of the 2 studies was performed by race in Meta-Analysis Helper, where this single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs9943291, was genome-wide significant with a meta-analysis(P) value of 3.71×10(-8).(HMGCS2), a part of the HMG-CoA synthase family, is important for ketogenesis and cholesterol synthesis pathways that are essential in glucose homeostasis. These results suggest that(HMGCS2) is a promising candidate gene involved in chlorthalidone and Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-induced glucose change. This may provide insights into the mechanisms involved in thiazide-induced hyperglycemia that may ultimately facilitate personalized approaches to antihypertensive selection for hypertension treatment.

29631748	Genome-wide association identifies a novel locus for delirium risk.	We aimed to identify common genetic variations associated with delirium through genome-wide association testing in a hospital biobank. We applied a published electronic health record-based definition of delirium to identify cases of delirium, and control individuals with no history of delirium, from a biobank spanning 2 Boston academic medical centers. Among 6035 individuals of northern European ancestry, including 421 with a history of delirium, we used logistic regression to examine genome-wide association. We identified one locus spanning multiple genes, including 3 interleukin-related genes, associated with p = 1.41e-8, and 5 other independent loci with p < 5e-7. Our results do not support previously reported candidate gene associations in delirium. Identifying common-variant associations with delirium may provide insight into the mechanisms responsible for this complex and multifactorial outcome. Using standardized claims-based phenotypes in biobanks should allow the larger scale investigations required to confirm novel loci such as the one we identify.	
29531279	Genome-wide association analysis identifies new candidate risk loci for familial intracranial aneurysm in the French-Canadian population.	Intracranial Aneurysm (IA) is a common disease with a worldwide prevalence of 1-3%. In the French-Canadian (FC) population, where there is an important founder effect, the incidence of IA is higher and is frequently seen in families. In this study, we genotyped a cohort of 257 mostly familial FC IA patients and 1,992 FC controls using the Illumina NeuroX SNP-chip. The most strongly associated loci were tested in 34 Inuit IA families and in 32 FC IA patients and 106 FC controls that had been exome sequenced (WES). After imputation, one locus at 3p14.2 (FHIT, rs1554600, p = 4.66 × 10(-9)) reached a genome-wide significant level of association and a subsequent validation in Nunavik Inuit cohort further confirmed the significance of the FHIT variant association (rs780365, FBAT-O, p = 0.002839). Additionally, among the other promising loci (p < 5 × 10(-6)), the one at 3q13.2 (rs78125721, p = 4.77 × 10(-7)), which encompasses CCDC80, also showed an increased mutation burden in the WES data (CCDC80, SKAT-O, p = 0.0005). In this study, we identified two new potential IA loci in the FC population: FHIT, which is significantly associated with hypertensive IA, and CCDC80, which has potential genetic and functional relevance to IA pathogenesis, providing evidence on the additional risk loci for familial IA. We also replicated the previous IA GWAS risk locus 18q11.2, and suggested a potential locus at 8p23.1 that warrants further study.	
29531354	Multiancestry genome-wide association study of 520,000 subjects identifies 32 loci associated with stroke and stroke subtypes.	Stroke has multiple etiologies, but the underlying genes and pathways are largely unknown. We conducted a multiancestry genome-wide-association meta-analysis in 521,612 individuals (67,162 cases and 454,450 controls) and discovered 22 new stroke risk loci, bringing the total to 32. We further found shared genetic variation with related vascular traits, including blood pressure, cardiac traits, and venous thromboembolism, at individual loci (n = 18), and using genetic risk scores and linkage-disequilibrium-score regression. Several loci exhibited distinct association and pleiotropy patterns for etiological stroke subtypes. Eleven new susceptibility loci indicate mechanisms not previously implicated in stroke pathophysiology, with prioritization of risk variants and genes accomplished through bioinformatics analyses using extensive functional datasets. Stroke risk loci were significantly enriched in drug targets for antithrombotic therapy.	
29527006	Genome-wide analyses of self-reported empathy: correlations with autism, schizophrenia, and anorexia nervosa.	Empathy is the ability to recognize and respond to the emotional states of other individuals. It is an important psychological process that facilitates navigating social interactions and maintaining relationships, which are important for well-being. Several psychological studies have identified difficulties in both self-report and performance-based measures of empathy in a range of psychiatric conditions. To date, no study has systematically investigated the genetic architecture of empathy using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we report the results of the largest GWAS of empathy to date using a well-validated self-report measure of empathy, the Empathy Quotient (EQ), in 46,861 research participants from 23andMe, Inc. We identify 11 suggestive loci (P < 1 × 10(-6)), though none were significant at P < 2.5 × 10(-8) after correcting for multiple testing. The most significant SNP was identified in the non-stratified analysis (rs4882760; P = 4.29 × 10(-8)), and is an intronic SNP in TMEM132C. The EQ had a modest but significant narrow-sense heritability (0.11 ± 0.014; P = 1.7 × 10(-14)). As predicted, based on earlier work, we confirmed a significant female advantage on the EQ (P < 2 × 10(-16), Cohen's d = 0.65). We identified similar SNP heritability and high genetic correlation between the sexes. Also, as predicted, we identified a significant negative genetic correlation between autism and the EQ (r(g) = -0.27 ± 0.07, P = 1.63 × 10(-4)). We also identified a significant positive genetic correlation between the EQ and risk for schizophrenia (r(g) = 0.19 ± 0.04; P = 1.36 × 10(-5)), risk for anorexia nervosa (r(g) = 0.32 ± 0.09; P = 6 × 10(-4)), and extraversion (r(g) = 0.45 ± 0.08; 5.7 × 10(-8)). This is the first GWAS of self-reported empathy. The results suggest that the genetic variations associated with empathy also play a role in psychiatric conditions and psychological traits.	
29532581	Genome-wide association study in Finnish twins highlights the connection between nicotine addiction and neurotrophin signaling pathway.	The heritability of nicotine dependence based on family studies is substantial. Nevertheless, knowledge of the underlying genetic architecture remains meager. Our aim was to identify novel genetic variants responsible for interindividual differences in smoking behavior. We performed a genome-wide association study on 1715 ever smokers ascertained from the population-based Finnish Twin Cohort enriched for heavy smoking. Data imputation used the 1000 Genomes Phase I reference panel together with a whole genome sequence-based Finnish reference panel. We analyzed three measures of nicotine addiction-smoking quantity, nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal. We annotated all genome-wide significant SNPs for their functional potential. First, we detected genome-wide significant association on 16p12 with smoking quantity (P = 8.5 × 10(-9) ), near CLEC19A. The lead-SNP stands 22 kb from a binding site for NF-κB transcription factors, which play a role in the neurotrophin signaling pathway. However, the signal was not replicated in an independent Finnish population-based sample, FINRISK (n = 6763). Second, nicotine withdrawal showed association on 2q21 in an intron of TMEM163 (P = 2.1 × 10(-9) ), and on 11p15 (P = 6.6 × 10(-8) ) in an intron of AP2A2, and P = 4.2 × 10(-7) for a missense variant in MUC6, both involved in the neurotrophin signaling pathway). Third, association was detected on 3p22.3 for maximum number of cigarettes smoked per day (P = 3.1 × 10(-8) ) near STAC. Associating CLEC19A and TMEM163 SNPs were annotated to influence gene expression or methylation. The neurotrophin signaling pathway has previously been associated with smoking behavior. Our findings further support the role in nicotine addiction.	
29534260	Two Genetic Variants Associated with Plantar Fascial Disorders.	Plantar fascial disorder is comprised of plantar fasciitis and plantar fibromatosis. Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain, especially for athletes involved in running and jumping sports. Plantar fibromatosis is a rare fibrous hyperproliferation of the deep connective tissue of the foot. To identify genetic loci associated with plantar fascial disorders, a genome-wide association screen was performed using publically available data from the Research Program in Genes, Environment and Health including 21,624 cases of plantar fascial disorders and 80,879 controls. One indel (chr5:118704153:D) and one SNP (rs62051384) showed an association with plantar fascial disorders at genome-wide significance (p<5×10(-8)) with small effects (odds ratios=0.93 and 1.07 per allele, respectively). The indel chr5:118704153:D is located within TNFAIP8 (encodes a protein induced by TNF alpha) and rs62051384 is located within WWP2 (which is involved in proteasomal degradation). These DNA variants may be informative in explaining why some individuals are at higher risk for plantar fascial disorders than others.	
29534301	Key HLA-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and role of the BTNL2 gene for response to a hepatitis B vaccine.	Approximately 5-10% of individuals who are vaccinated with a hepatitis B (HB) vaccine designed based on the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype C fail to acquire protective levels of antibodies. Here, host genetic factors behind low immune response to this HB vaccine were investigated by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) association tests. The GWAS and HLA association tests were carried out using a total of 1,193 Japanese individuals including 107 low responders, 351 intermediate responders, and 735 high responders. Classical HLA class II alleles were statistically imputed using the genome-wide SNP typing data. The GWAS identified independent associations of HLA-DRB1-DQB1, HLA-DPB1 and BTNL2 genes with immune response to a HB vaccine designed based on the HBV genotype C. Five HLA-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and two DPB1 alleles showed significant associations with response to the HB vaccine in a comparison of three groups of 1,193 HB vaccinated individuals. When frequencies of DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and DPB1 alleles were compared between low immune responders and HBV patients, significant associations were identified for three DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, and no association was identified for any of the DPB1 alleles. In contrast, no association was identified for DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and DPB1 alleles in a comparison between high immune responders and healthy individuals. Conclusion: The findings in this study clearly show the importance of HLA-DR-DQ (i.e., recognition of a vaccine related HB surface antigen (HBsAg) by specific DR-DQ haplotypes) and BTNL2 molecules (i.e., high immune response to HB vaccine) for response to a HB vaccine designed based on the HBV genotype C. (Hepatology 2018).	
29538362	Surgical necrotizing enterocolitis in extremely premature neonates is associated with genetic variations in an intergenic region of chromosome 8.	BackgroundTwin studies suggest that genetic factors may account for up to 50% increased risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), but genome-wide association studies for NEC are lacking.MethodsGenotyping was done on Illumina BeadChip, followed by analysis using PLINK with logistic regression under an additive model.ResultsAmong 751 extremely-low-birth-weight (<1,000 g, >401 g) neonates, 30 had surgical NEC. Two hundred and sixty-one single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed association with NEC at P<0.05, of which 35 were significant at P<10(-7). Minor allele(s) in a cluster of SNPs spanning a 43-kb region of chromosome 8 (8q23.3) conferred an odds ratio of 4.72 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.51-8.88) for elevated risk of NEC. Two smaller clusters on chromosome 14 and chromosome 11 exhibited P values of 10(-7)-10(-8). The chromosome 8 cluster is in an intergenic region between CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3 (-1.43 Mb) and trichorhinophalangeal syndrome I (+542 kb). RNA sequencing in this region identified a potential novel open-reading frame corresponding to a long interspersed element-1 retrotransposable element.ConclusionGenetic variation in an intergenic region of chromosome 8 is associated with increased risk for NEC with a mechanism that is yet to be identified.	
29547969	A genome-wide association study of IgM antibody against phosphorylcholine: shared genetics and phenotypic relationship to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Phosphorylcholine (PC) is an epitope on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), apoptotic cells and several pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae. Immunoglobulin M against PC (IgM anti-PC) has the ability to inhibit uptake of oxLDL by macrophages and increase clearance of apoptotic cells. From our genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in four European-ancestry cohorts, six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 11q24.1 were discovered (in 3002 individuals) and replicated (in 646 individuals) to be associated with serum level of IgM anti-PC (the leading SNP rs35923643-G, combined β = 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.24, P = 4.3 × 10-11). The haplotype tagged by rs35923643-G (or its proxy SNP rs735665-A) is also known as the top risk allele for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a main increasing allele for general IgM. By using summary GWAS results of IgM anti-PC and CLL in the polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis, PRS on the basis of IgM anti-PC risk alleles positively associated with CLL risk (explained 0.6% of CLL variance, P = 1.2 × 10-15). Functional prediction suggested that rs35923643-G might impede the binding of Runt-related transcription factor 3, a tumor suppressor playing a central role in the immune regulation of cancers. Contrary to the expectations from the shared genetics between IgM anti-PC and CLL, an inverse relationship at the phenotypic level was found in a nested case-control study (30 CLL cases with 90 age- and sex-matched controls), potentially reflecting reverse causation. The suggested function of the top variant as well as the phenotypic association between IgM anti-PC and CLL risk needs replication and motivates further studies.	
29545352	Genome-Wide Association Studies of Metabolites in Patients with CKD Identify Multiple Loci and Illuminate Tubular Transport Mechanisms.	(Background) The kidneys have a central role in the generation, turnover, transport, and excretion of metabolites, and these functions can be altered in CKD. Genetic studies of metabolite concentrations can identify proteins performing these functions.(Methods) We conducted genome-wide association studies and aggregate rare variant tests of the concentrations of 139 serum metabolites and 41 urine metabolites, as well as their pairwise ratios and fractional excretions in up to 1168 patients with CKD.(Results) After correction for multiple testing, genome-wide significant associations were detected for 25 serum metabolites, two urine metabolites, and 259 serum and 14 urinary metabolite ratios. These included associations already known from population-based studies. Additional findings included an association for the uremic toxin putrescine and variants upstream of an enzyme catalyzing the oxidative deamination of polyamines ((AOC1),(P)-min=2.4×10(-12)), a relatively high carrier frequency (2%) for rare deleterious missense variants in(ACADM) that are collectively associated with serum ratios of medium-chain acylcarnitines ((P)-burden=6.6×10(-16)), and associations of a common variant in(SLC7A9) with several ratios of lysine to neutral amino acids in urine, including the lysine/glutamine ratio ((P)=2.2×10(-23)). The associations of this(SLC7A9) variant with ratios of lysine to specific neutral amino acids were much stronger than the association with lysine concentration alone. This finding is consistent with(SLC7A9) functioning as an exchanger of urinary cationic amino acids against specific intracellular neutral amino acids at the apical membrane of proximal tubular cells.(Conclusions) Metabolomic indices of specific kidney functions in genetic studies may provide insight into human renal physiology.	
29551627	Susceptibility to corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression: a genome-wide association study.	A serious adverse effect of corticosteroid therapy is adrenal suppression. Our aim was to identify genetic variants affecting susceptibility to corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression. We enrolled children with asthma who used inhaled corticosteroids as part of their treatment from 25 sites across the UK (discovery cohort), as part of the Pharmacogenetics of Adrenal Suppression with Inhaled Steroids (PASS) study. We included two validation cohorts, one comprising children with asthma (PASS study) and the other consisting of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) who were recruited from two UK centres for the Pharmacogenomics of Adrenal Suppression in COPD (PASIC) study. Participants underwent a low-dose short synacthen test. Adrenal suppression was defined as peak cortisol less than 350 nmol/L (in children) and less than 500 nmol/L (in adults). A case-control genome-wide association study was done with the control subset augmented by Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) participants. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that fulfilled criteria to be advanced to replication were tested by a random-effects inverse variance meta-analysis. This report presents the primary analysis. The PASS study is registered in the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). The PASS study is complete whereas the PASIC study is ongoing. Between November, 2008, and September, 2011, 499 children were enrolled to the discovery cohort. Between October, 2011, and December, 2012, 81 children were enrolled to the paediatric validation cohort, and from February, 2010, to June, 2015, 78 adults were enrolled to the adult validation cohort. Adrenal suppression was present in 35 (7%) children in the discovery cohort and six (7%) children and 17 (22%) adults in the validation cohorts. In the discovery cohort, 40 SNPs were found to be associated with adrenal suppression (genome-wide significance p<1 × 10(-6)), including an intronic SNP within the PDGFD gene locus (rs591118; odds ratio [OR] 7·32, 95% CI 3·15-16·99; p=5·8 × 10(-8)). This finding for rs591118 was validated successfully in both the paediatric asthma (OR 3·86, 95% CI 1·19-12·50; p=0·02) and adult COPD (2·41, 1·10-5·28; p=0·03) cohorts. The proportions of patients with adrenal suppression by rs591118 genotype were six (3%) of 214 patients with the GG genotype, 15 (6%) of 244 with the AG genotype, and 22 (25%) of 87 with the AA genotype. Meta-analysis of the paediatric cohorts (discovery and validation) and all three cohorts showed genome-wide significance of rs591118 (respectively, OR 5·89, 95% CI 2·97-11·68; p=4·3 × 10(-9); and 4·05, 2·00-8·21; p=3·5 × 10(-10)). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the PDGFD gene locus increases the risk of adrenal suppression in children and adults who use corticosteroids to treat asthma and COPD, respectively.

29551738	Interactions Between Genetic Variants and Environmental Factors Affect Risk of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma and Barrett's Esophagus.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 susceptibility loci for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, variants in these loci account for a small fraction of cases of EA and BE. Genetic factors might interact with environmental factors to affect risk of EA and BE. We aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may modify the associations of body mass index (BMI), smoking, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), with risks of EA and BE. We collected data on single BMI measurements, smoking status, and symptoms of GERD from 2284 patients with EA, 3104 patients with BE, and 2182 healthy individuals (controls) participating in the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium GWAS, the UK Barrett's Esophagus Gene Study, and the UK Stomach and Oesophageal Cancer Study. We analyzed 993,501 SNPs in DNA samples of all study subjects. We used standard case-control logistic regression to test for gene-environment interactions. For EA, rs13429103 at chromosome 2p25.1, near the RNF144A-LOC339788 gene, showed a borderline significant interaction with smoking status (P = 2.18×10(-7)). Ever smoking was associated with an almost 12-fold increase in risk of EA among individuals with rs13429103-AA genotype (odds ratio=11.82; 95% CI, 4.03-34.67). Three SNPs (rs12465911, rs2341926, rs13396805) at chromosome 2q23.3, near the RND3-RBM43 gene, interacted with GERD symptoms (P = 1.70×10(-7), P = 1.83×10(-7), and P = 3.58×10(-7), respectively) to affect risk of EA. For BE, rs491603 at chromosome 1p34.3, near the EIF2C3 gene, and rs11631094 at chromosome 15q14, at the SLC12A6 gene, interacted with BMI (P = 4.44×10(-7)) and pack-years of smoking history (P = 2.82×10(-7)), respectively. The associations of BMI, smoking, and GERD symptoms with risks of EA and BE appear to vary with SNPs at chromosomes 1, 2, and 15. Validation of these suggestive interactions is warranted.
29743933	Fast and Accurate Genome-Wide Association Test of Multiple Quantitative Traits.	Multiple correlated traits are often collected in genetic studies. By jointly analyzing multiple traits, we can increase power by aggregating multiple weak effects and reveal additional insights into the genetic architecture of complex human diseases. In this article, we propose a multivariate linear regression-based method to test the joint association of multiple quantitative traits. It is flexible to accommodate any covariates, has very accurate control of type I errors, and offers very competitive performance. We also discuss fast and accurate significance(p) value computation especially for genome-wide association studies with small-to-medium sample sizes. We demonstrate through extensive numerical studies that the proposed method has competitive performance. Its usefulness is further illustrated with application to genome-wide association analysis of diabetes-related traits in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We found some very interesting associations with diabetes traits which have not been reported before. We implemented the proposed methods in a publicly available R package.	
29558500	Genome-wide association analysis identifies multiple loci associated with kidney disease-related traits in Korean populations.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important social health problem characterized by a decrease in the kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In this study, we analyzed genome-wide association studies for kidney disease-related traits using data from a Korean adult health screening cohort comprising 7,064 participants. Kidney disease-related traits analyzed include blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, estimated GFR, and uric acid levels. We detected two genetic loci (SLC14A2 and an intergenic region) and 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BUN, 3 genetic loci (BCAS3, C17orf82, ALDH2) and 6 SNPs associated with serum creatinine, 3 genetic loci (BCAS3, C17orf82/TBX2, LRP2) and 7 SNPs associated with GFR, and 14 genetic loci (3 in ABCG2/PKD2, 2 in SLC2A9, 3 in intergenic regions on chromosome 4; OTUB1, NRXN2/SLC22A12, CDC42BPG, RPS6KA4, SLC22A9, and MAP4K2 on chromosome 11) and 84 SNPs associated with uric acid levels. By comparing significant genetic loci associated with serum creatinine levels and GFR, rs9895661 in BCAS3 and rs757608 in C17orf82 were simultaneously associated with both traits. The SNPs rs11710227 in intergenic regions on chromosome 3 showing significant association with BUN is newly discovered. Genetic variations of multiple gene loci are associated with kidney disease-related traits, and differences in associations between kidney disease-related traits and genetic variation are dependent on the population. The meanings of the mutations identified in this study will need to be reaffirmed in other population groups in the future.	
29559738	A genome-wide association study on photic sneeze syndrome in a Japanese population.	Photic sneeze syndrome (PSS) is characterized by a tendency to sneeze when the eye is exposed to bright light. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PSS in Caucasian populations. We performed a GWAS on PSS in Japanese individuals who responded to a web-based survey and provided saliva samples. After quality control, genotype data of 210,086 SNPs in 11,409 individuals were analyzed. The overall prevalence of PSS was 3.2%. Consistent with previous reports, SNPs at 3p12.1 were associated with PSS at genome-wide significance (p < 5.0 × 10(-8)). Furthermore, two novel loci at 9q34.2 and 4q35.2 reached suggestive significance (p < 5.0 × 10(-6)). Our data also provided evidence supporting the two additional SNPs on 2q22.3 and 9q33.2 reportedly associated with PSS. Our study reproduced previous findings in Caucasian populations and further suggested novel PSS loci in the Japanese population.	
29559693	Genome-wide analyses using UK Biobank data provide insights into the genetic architecture of osteoarthritis.	Osteoarthritis is a common complex disease imposing a large public-health burden. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study for osteoarthritis, using data across 16.5 million variants from the UK Biobank resource. After performing replication and meta-analysis in up to 30,727 cases and 297,191 controls, we identified nine new osteoarthritis loci, in all of which the most likely causal variant was noncoding. For three loci, we detected association with biologically relevant radiographic endophenotypes, and in five signals we identified genes that were differentially expressed in degraded compared with intact articular cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis. We established causal effects on osteoarthritis for higher body mass index but not for triglyceride levels or genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.	
29563502	Placenta and appetite genes GDF15 and IGFBP7 are associated with hyperemesis gravidarum.	Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, occurs in 0.3-2% of pregnancies and is associated with maternal and fetal morbidity. The cause of HG remains unknown, but familial aggregation and results of twin studies suggest that understanding the genetic contribution is essential for comprehending the disease etiology. Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for binary (HG) and ordinal (severity of nausea and vomiting) phenotypes of pregnancy complications. Two loci, chr19p13.11 and chr4q12, are genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10(-8)) in both association scans and are replicated in an independent cohort. The genes implicated at these two loci are GDF15 and IGFBP7 respectively, both known to be involved in placentation, appetite, and cachexia. While proving the casual roles of GDF15 and IGFBP7 in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy requires further study, this GWAS provides insights into the genetic risk factors contributing to the disease.	
29566793	Genome-wide Analyses Identify KIF5A as a Novel ALS Gene.	To identify novel genes associated with ALS, we undertook two lines of investigation. We carried out a genome-wide association study comparing 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Independently, we performed a rare variant burden analysis comparing 1,138 index familial ALS cases and 19,494 controls. Through both approaches, we identified kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) as a novel gene associated with ALS. Interestingly, mutations predominantly in the N-terminal motor domain of KIF5A are causative for two neurodegenerative diseases: hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2). In contrast, ALS-associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain and patients harboring loss-of-function mutations displayed an extended survival relative to typical ALS cases. Taken together, these results broaden the phenotype spectrum resulting from mutations in KIF5A and strengthen the role of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of ALS.	
29563342	Untargeted metabolomics identifies trimethyllysine, a TMAO-producing nutrient precursor, as a predictor of incident cardiovascular disease risk.	Using an untargeted metabolomics approach in initial (N = 99 subjects) and replication cohorts (N = 1,162), we discovered and structurally identified a plasma metabolite associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks, N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine (trimethyllysine, TML). Stable-isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry analyses of an independent validation cohort (N = 2,140) confirmed TML levels are independently associated with incident (3-year) major adverse cardiovascular event risks (hazards ratio [HR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4) and incident (5-year) mortality risk (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.0-4.2). Genome-wide association studies identified several suggestive loci for TML levels, but none reached genome-wide significance; and d9(trimethyl)-TML isotope tracer studies confirmed TML can serve as a nutrient precursor for gut microbiota-dependent generation of trimethylamine (TMA) and the atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Although TML was shown to be abundant in both plant- and animal-derived foods, mouse and human fecal cultures (omnivores and vegans) showed slow conversion of TML to TMA. Furthermore, unlike chronic dietary choline, TML supplementation in mice failed to elevate plasma TMAO or heighten thrombosis potential in vivo. Thus, TML is identified as a strong predictor of incident CVD risks in subjects and to serve as a dietary precursor for gut microbiota-dependent generation of TMAO; however, TML does not appear to be a major microbial source for TMAO generation in vivo.	
29628937	A Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies of Growth Differentiation Factor-15 Concentration in Blood.	Blood levels of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), also known as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), have been associated with various pathological processes and diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Prior studies suggest genetic factors play a role in regulating blood MIC-1/GDF-15 concentration. In the current study, we conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date using a sample of ∼5,400 community-based Caucasian participants, to determine the genetic variants associated with MIC-1/GDF-15 blood concentration. Conditional and joint (COJO), gene-based association, and gene-set enrichment analyses were also carried out to identify novel loci, genes, and pathways. Consistent with prior results, a locus on chromosome 19, which includes nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (top SNP, rs888663,(p) = 1.690 × 10(-35)), was significantly associated with blood MIC-1/GDF-15 concentration, and explained 21.47% of its variance. COJO analysis showed evidence for two independent signals within this locus. Gene-based analysis confirmed the chromosome 19 locus association and in addition, a putative locus on chromosome 1. Gene-set enrichment analyses showed that the"COPI-mediated anterograde transport" gene-set was associated with MIC-1/GDF15 blood concentration with marginal significance after FDR correction ((p) = 0.067). In conclusion, a locus on chromosome 19 was associated with MIC-1/GDF-15 blood concentration with genome-wide significance, with evidence for a new locus (chromosome 1). Future studies using independent cohorts are needed to confirm the observed associations especially for the chromosomes 1 locus, and to further investigate and identify the causal SNPs that contribute to MIC-1/GDF-15 levels.	
29572449	Genetic markers for urine haptoglobin is associated with decline in renal function in type 2 diabetes in East Asians.	Urine haptoglobin (uHP) level prospectively predicts diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. Here, we aim to identify genetic determinants of uHP level and evaluate association with renal function in East Asians (EA) with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) among 805 [236 Chinese (discovery) and 569 (57 Malay and 512 Chinese) (validation)] found that rs75444904/kgp16506790 variant was robustly associated with uHP level (MetaP = 1.21 × 10(-60)). rs75444904 correlates well with plasma HP protein levels and multimerization in EA but was not in perfect LD (r(2) = 0.911 in Chinese, r(2) = 0.536 in Malay) and is monomorphic in Europeans (1000 G data). Conditional probability analysis indicated weakening of effects but residual significant associations between rs75444904 and uHP when adjusted on HP structural variant (MetaP = 8.22 × 10(-7)). The rs75444904 variant was associated with DKD progression (OR = 1.77, P = 0.014) independent of traditional risk factors. In an additional validation-cohort of EA (410 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cases and 1308 controls), rs75444904 was associated with ESRD (OR = 1.22, P = 0.036). Furthermore, increased risk of DKD progression (OR = 2.09, P = 0.007) with elevated uHP level through Mendelian randomisation analysis provide support for potential causal role of uHP in DKD progression in EA. However, further replication of our findings in larger study populations is warranted.	
29590334	A rare missense mutation in MYH6 associates with non-syndromic coarctation of the aorta.	Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) accounts for 4-8% of congenital heart defects (CHDs) and confers substantial morbidity despite treatment. It is increasingly recognized as a highly heritable condition. The aim of the study was to search for sequence variants that affect the risk of CoA. We performed a genome-wide association study of CoA among Icelanders (120 cases and 355 166 controls) based on imputed variants identified through whole-genome sequencing. We found association with a rare (frequency = 0.34%) missense mutation p.Arg721Trp in MYH6 (odds ratio = 44.2, P = 5.0 × 10-22), encoding the alpha-heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin, an essential sarcomere protein. Approximately 20% of individuals with CoA in Iceland carry this mutation. We show that p.Arg721Trp also associates with other CHDs, in particular bicuspid aortic valve. We have previously reported broad effects of p.Arg721Trp on cardiac electrical function and strong association with sick sinus syndrome and atrial fibrillation. Through a population approach, we found that a rare missense mutation p.Arg721Trp in the sarcomere gene MYH6 has a strong effect on the risk of CoA and explains a substantial fraction of the Icelanders with CoA. This is the first mutation associated with non-familial or sporadic form of CoA at a population level. The p.Arg721Trp in MYH6 causes a cardiac syndrome with highly variable expressivity and emphasizes the importance of sarcomere integrity for cardiac development and function.	
29617998	Genome-wide association analyses identify new loci influencing intraocular pressure.	Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. While previous studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with IOP, these loci only explain a fraction of IOP heritability. Recently established of biobank repositories have resulted in large amounts of data, enabling the identification of the remaining heritability for complex traits. Here, we describe the largest genome-wide association study of IOP to date using participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. We identified 671 directly genotyped variants that are significantly associated with IOP (P < 5 × 10-8). In addition to 103 novel loci, the top ranked novel IOP genes are LMX1B, NR1H3, MADD and SEPT9. We replicated these findings in an external population and examined the pleiotropic nature of these loci. These discoveries not only further our understanding of the genetic architecture of IOP, but also shed new light on the biological processes underlying glaucoma.	
29594489	Host genetic susceptibility to Clostridium difficile infections in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation: a genome-wide association study.	Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common hospital-acquired infection. Unfortunately, genes that identify CDI-susceptible patients have not been well described. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to determine genetic variants associated with the development of CDI. A cohort study of Caucasian patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma was performed. Patients were genotyped using Illumina® Whole Genome Genotyping Infinium chemistry. We then compared CDI-positive to CDI-negative patients using logistic regression for baseline clinical factors and false discovery rate (FDR) for genetic factors [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]. SNPs associated with CDI at FDR of p < 0.01 were then incorporated into a logistic regression model combining clinical and genetic factors. Of the 646 patients analyzed (59.7% male), 57 patients were tested CDI positive (cases) and were compared to 589 patients who were tested negative (controls). Hemoglobin, albumin, and hematocrit were lower for cases (p < 0.05). Eight SNPs on five genes (FLJ16171, GORASP2, RLBP1L1, ASPH, ATP7B) were associated with CDI at FDR p < 0.01. In the combined clinical and genetic model, low albumin and three genes RLBP1L1, ASPH, and ATP7B were associated with CDI. Low serum albumin and genes RLBP1L1 and ASPH located on chromosome 8 and ATP7B on chromosome 13 were associated with CDI. Of particular interest is ATP7B given its copper modulatory role and the sporicidal properties of copper against Clostridium difficile.	
29596498	Analyses of genome wide association data, cytokines, and gene expression in African-Americans with benign ethnic neutropenia.	Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a hematologic condition associated with people of African ancestry and specific Middle Eastern ethnic groups. Prior genetic association studies in large population showed that rs2814778 in Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) gene, specifically DARC null red cell phenotype, was associated with BEN. However, the mechanism of this red cell phenotype leading to low white cell count remained elusive. We conducted an extreme phenotype design genome-wide association study (GWAS), analyzed ~16 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 1,178 African-Americans individuals from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and replicated from 819 African-American participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Conditional analyses on rs2814778 were performed to identify additional association signals on chromosome 1q22. In a separate cohort of healthy individuals with and without BEN, whole genome gene expression from peripheral blood neutrophils were analyzed for DARC. We confirmed that rs2814778 in DARC was associated with BEN (p = 4.09×10-53). Conditioning on rs2814778 abolished other significant chromosome 1 associations. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, 6, and 10) in participants in the Howard University Family Study (HUFS) and Multi-Ethnic Study in Atherosclerosis (MESA) showed similar levels in individuals homozygous for the rs2814778 allele compared to others, indicating cytokine sink hypothesis played a minor role in leukocyte homeostasis. Gene expression in neutrophils of individuals with and without BEN was also similar except for low DARC expression in BEN, suggesting normal function. BEN neutrophils had slightly activated profiles in leukocyte migration and hematopoietic stem cell mobilization pathways (expression fold change <2). These results in humans support the notion of DARC null erythroid progenitors preferentially differentiating to myeloid cells, leading to activated DARC null neutrophils egressing from circulation to the spleen, and causing relative neutropenia. Collectively, these human data sufficiently explained the mechanism DARC null red cell phenotype causing BEN and further provided a biologic basis that BEN is clinically benign.	
29603369	Clinical and genetic risk factors for decreased bone mineral density in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease.	Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at a high risk of low bone mineral density (BMD). Reportedly, clinical and genetic factors cause low BMD in Caucasians; however, studies in non-Caucasian populations remain scarce. Clinical risk factors for low BMD were investigated in 266 Japanese patients with IBD, and a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was performed using linear regression with associated clinical factors as covariates. Genotyping was performed using a population-optimized genotyping array (Japonica array(®) ). After quality control, the genotype data of 4 384 682 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 254 patients with IBD were used for GWAS. Body mass index, age, and disease duration were independently associated with the BMD of the femoral neck (P = 1.41E - 13, 1.04E - 5, and 1.58E - 3, respectively), and body mass index and sex were associated with the BMD of the lumbar spine (P = 6.90E - 10 and 6.84E - 3, respectively). In GWAS, 118 and 42 candidate SNPs of the femoral neck and lumbar spine, respectively, were identified. Among 118, 111 candidate SNPs of the femoral neck were located within the SLC22A23 gene, which is a known IBD susceptibility gene (minimum P = 1.42E - 07). Among 42, 18 candidate SNPs of the lumbar spine were located within the MECOM gene, which is associated with osteopenia (minimum P = 5.86E - 07). Interestingly, none of the known loci showed a significant association with BMD. Although clinical risk factors for low BMD in IBD were similar to those in the general population, genetic risk factors were rather different.	
29608535	Genetic Survey of Adult-Onset Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.	Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure of unknown cause. IIH has been shown to be associated with female sex as well as obesity. This genome-wide association study was performed to determine whether genetic variants are associated with this condition. We analyzed the chromosomal DNA of 95 patients with IIH enrolled in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial and 95 controls matched on sex, body mass index, and self-reported ethnicity. The samples were genotyped using Illumina Infinium HumanCoreExome v1-0 array and analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model that accounted for population stratification using multidimensional scaling. A total of 301,908 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated. The strongest associations observed were for rs2234671 on chromosome 2 (P = 4.93 × 10), rs79642714 on chromosome 6 (P = 2.12 × 10), and rs200288366 on chromosome 12 (P = 6.23 × 10). In addition, 3 candidate regions marked by multiple associated SNPs were identified on chromosome 5, 13, and 14. This is the first study to investigate the genetics of IIH in a rigorously characterized cohort. The study was limited by its modest size and thus would have only been able to demonstrate highly significant association on a genome-wide scale for relatively common alleles exerting large effects. However, several variants and loci were identified that might be strong candidates for follow-up studies in other well-phenotyped cohorts.	
29650764	Genetic Variants Influencing Plasma Renin Activity in Hypertensive Patients From the PEAR Study (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses).	Plasma renin is an important regulator of blood pressure (BP). Plasma renin activity (PRA) has been shown to correlate with variability in BP response to antihypertensive agents. We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with baseline PRA using data from the PEAR study (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed in 461 whites and 297 blacks using an additive model, adjusting for age, sex, and ancestry-specific principal components. Top SNPs were prioritized by testing the expected direction of association for BP response to atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide. Top regions from the BP response prioritization were tested for functional evidence through differences in gene expression by genotype using RNA sequencing data. Regions with functional evidence were assessed for replication with baseline PRA in an independent study (PEAR-2). Our top SNP rs3784921 was in the(SNN-TXNDC11) gene region. The G allele of rs3784921 was associated with higher baseline PRA (β=0.47;(P)=2.09×10(-6)) and smaller systolic BP reduction in response to hydrochlorothiazide (β=2.97; 1-sided(P)=0.006). In addition,(TXNDC11) expression differed by rs3784921 genotype ((P)=0.007), and rs1802409, a proxy SNP for rs3784921 ((r)(2)=0.98-1.00), replicated in PEAR-2 (β=0.15; 1-sided(P)=0.038). Additional SNPs associated with baseline PRA that passed BP response prioritization were in/near the genes(CHD9, XIRP2,) and(GHR.) CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple regions associated with baseline PRA that were prioritized through BP response signals to 2 mechanistically different antihypertensive drugs.

29608257	Genetic overlap between endometriosis and endometrial cancer: evidence from cross-disease genetic correlation and GWAS meta-analyses.	Epidemiological, biological, and molecular data suggest links between endometriosis and endometrial cancer, with recent epidemiological studies providing evidence for an association between a previous diagnosis of endometriosis and risk of endometrial cancer. We used genetic data as an alternative approach to investigate shared biological etiology of these two diseases. Genetic correlation analysis of summary level statistics from genomewide association studies (GWAS) using LD Score regression revealed moderate but significant genetic correlation (r(g ) = 0.23, P = 9.3 × 10(-3) ), and SNP effect concordance analysis provided evidence for significant SNP pleiotropy (P = 6.0 × 10(-3) ) and concordance in effect direction (P = 2.0 × 10(-3) ) between the two diseases. Cross-disease GWAS meta-analysis highlighted 13 distinct loci associated at P ≤ 10(-5) with both endometriosis and endometrial cancer, with one locus (SNP rs2475335) located within PTPRD associated at a genomewide significant level (P = 4.9 × 10(-8) , OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.07-1.15). PTPRD acts in the STAT3 pathway, which has been implicated in both endometriosis and endometrial cancer. This study demonstrates the value of cross-disease genetic analysis to support epidemiological observations and to identify biological pathways of relevance to multiple diseases.	
29618737	Genome-wide association study and meta-analysis identify loci associated with ventricular and supraventricular ectopy.	The genetic basis of supraventricular and ventricular ectopy (SVE, VE) remains largely uncharacterized, despite established genetic mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis. To identify novel genetic variants associated with SVE/VE in ancestrally diverse human populations, we conducted a genome-wide association study of electrocardiographically identified SVE and VE in five cohorts including approximately 43,000 participants of African, European and Hispanic/Latino ancestry. In thirteen ancestry-stratified subgroups, we tested multivariable-adjusted associations of SVE and VE with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dosage. We combined subgroup-specific association estimates in inverse variance-weighted, fixed-effects and Bayesian meta-analyses. We also combined fixed-effects meta-analytic t-test statistics for SVE and VE in multi-trait SNP association analyses. No loci reached genome-wide significance in trans-ethnic meta-analyses. However, we found genome-wide significant SNPs intronic to an apoptosis-enhancing gene previously associated with QRS interval duration (FAF1; lead SNP rs7545860; effect allele frequency = 0.02; P = 2.0 × 10(-8)) in multi-trait analysis among European ancestry participants and near a locus encoding calcium-dependent glycoproteins (DSC3; lead SNP rs8086068; effect allele frequency = 0.17) in meta-analysis of SVE (P = 4.0 × 10(-8)) and multi-trait analysis (P = 2.9 × 10(-9)) among African ancestry participants. The novel findings suggest several mechanisms by which genetic variation may predispose to ectopy in humans and highlight the potential value of leveraging pleiotropy in future studies of ectopy-related phenotypes.	
29626450	Female-Specific Association Between Variants on Chromosome 9 and Self-Reported Diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.	Genetic factors are believed to affect risk for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but there have been no sufficiently powered and adequately sized studies. To identify DNA variants associated with IBS risk, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the large UK Biobank population-based cohort, which includes genotype and health data from 500,000 participants. We studied 7,287,191 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms in individuals who self-reported a doctor's diagnosis of IBS (cases; n = 9576) compared to the remainder of the cohort (controls; n = 336,499) (mean age of study subjects, 40-69 years). Genome-wide significant findings were further investigated in 2045 patients with IBS from tertiary centers and 7955 population controls from Europe and the United States, and a small general population sample from Sweden (n = 249). Functional annotation of GWAS results was carried out by integrating data from multiple biorepositories to obtain biological insights from the observed associations. We identified a genome-wide significant association on chromosome 9q31.2 (single nucleotide polymorphism rs10512344; P = 3.57 × 10(-8)) in a region previously linked to age at menarche, and 13 additional loci of suggestive significance (P < 5.0×10(-6)). Sex-stratified analyses revealed that the variants at 9q31.2 affect risk of IBS in women only (P = 4.29 × 10(-10) in UK Biobank) and also associate with constipation-predominant IBS in women (P = .015 in the tertiary cohort) and harder stools in women (P = .0012 in the population-based sample). Functional annotation of the 9q31.2 locus identified 8 candidate genes, including the elongator complex protein 1 gene (ELP1 or IKBKAP), which is mutated in patients with familial dysautonomia. In a sufficiently powered GWAS of IBS, we associated variants at the locus 9q31.2 with risk of IBS in women. This observation may provide additional rationale for investigating the role of sex hormones and autonomic dysfunction in IBS.	
29621232	Identification and functional analysis of glycemic trait loci in the China Health and Nutrition Survey.	To identify genetic contributions to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related glycemic traits (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA1c), we conducted genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) in up to 7,178 Chinese subjects from nine provinces in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). We examined patterns of population structure within CHNS and found that allele frequencies differed across provinces, consistent with genetic drift and population substructure. We further validated 32 previously described T2D- and glycemic trait-loci, including G6PC2 and SIX3-SIX2 associated with fasting glucose. At G6PC2, we replicated a known fasting glucose-associated variant (rs34177044) and identified a second signal (rs2232326), a low-frequency (4%), probably damaging missense variant (S324P). A variant within the lead fasting glucose-associated signal at SIX3-SIX2 co-localized with pancreatic islet expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for SIX3, SIX2, and three noncoding transcripts. To identify variants functionally responsible for the fasting glucose association at SIX3-SIX2, we tested five candidate variants for allelic differences in regulatory function. The rs12712928-C allele, associated with higher fasting glucose and lower transcript expression level, showed lower transcriptional activity in reporter assays and increased binding to GABP compared to the rs12712928-G, suggesting that rs12712928-C contributes to elevated fasting glucose levels by disrupting an islet enhancer, resulting in reduced gene expression. Taken together, these analyses identified multiple loci associated with glycemic traits across China, and suggest a regulatory mechanism at the SIX3-SIX2 fasting glucose GWAS locus.	
29622589	Genome-Wide Associations of Global Electrical Heterogeneity ECG Phenotype: The ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) Study and CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study).	ECG global electrical heterogeneity (GEH) is associated with sudden cardiac death. We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study would identify genetic loci related to GEH. We tested genotyped and imputed variants in black (N=3057) and white (N=10 769) participants in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study and CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study). GEH (QRS-T angle, sum absolute QRST integral, spatial ventricular gradient magnitude, elevation, azimuth) was measured on 12-lead ECGs. Linear regression models were constructed with each GEH variable as an outcome, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, study site, and principal components to account for ancestry. GWAS identified 10 loci that showed genome-wide significant association with GEH in whites or joint ancestry. The strongest signal (rs7301677, near(TBX3)) was associated with QRS-T angle (white standardized β+0.16 [95% CI 0.13-0.19];(P)=1.5×10(-26)), spatial ventricular gradient elevation (+0.11 [0.08-0.14];(P)=2.1×10(-12)), and spatial ventricular gradient magnitude (-0.12 [95% CI -0.15 to -0.09];(P)=5.9×10(-15)). Altogether, GEH-SNPs explained 1.1% to 1.6% of GEH variance. Loci on chromosomes 4 (near(HMCN2)), 5 ((IGF1R)), 11 (11p11.2 region cluster), and 7 (near(ACTB)) are novel ECG phenotype-associated loci. Several loci significantly associated with gene expression in the left ventricle ((HMCN2) locus-with(HMCN2);(IGF1R) locus-with(IGF1R)), and atria ((RP11-481J2.2) locus-with expression of a long non-coding RNA and(NDRG4)). We identified 10 genetic loci associated with ECG GEH. Replication of GEH GWAS findings in independent cohorts is warranted. Further studies of GEH-loci may uncover mechanisms of arrhythmogenic remodeling in response to cardiovascular risk factors.	
29632305	New Common and Rare Variants Influencing Metabolic Syndrome and Its Individual Components in a Korean Population.	To identify novel loci for susceptibility to MetS, we conducted genome-wide association and exome wide association studies consisting of a discovery stage cohort (KARE, 1946 cases and 6427 controls), and a replication stage cohort (HEXA, 430 cases and 3,264 controls). For finding genetic variants for MetS, with its components, we performed multivariate analysis for common and rare associations, using a standard logistic regression analysis for MetS. From the discovery and replication GWA studies, we confirmed 21 genome-wide signals significantly associated with MetS. Of these 21, four were previously unreported to associate with any MetS components: rs765547 near LPL; rs3782889 in MYL2; and rs11065756 and rs10849915 in CCDC63. Using exome chip variants, gene-based analysis of rare variants revealed three genes, CETP, SH2B1, and ZFP2, in the discovery stage, among which only CETP was confirmed in the replication stage. Finally, CETP D442G (rs2303790) associated, as a less common variant, with decreased risk of MetS. In conclusion, we discovered a total of five new MetS-associated loci, and their overlap with other disease-related components, suggest roles in the various etiologies of MetS, and its possible preventive strategies.	
29632299	Genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for B-cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have advanced our understanding of susceptibility to B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL); however, much of the heritable risk remains unidentified. Here, we perform a GWAS and conduct a meta-analysis with two existing GWAS, totaling 2442 cases and 14,609 controls. We identify risk loci for BCP-ALL at 8q24.21 (rs28665337, P = 3.86 × 10(-9), odds ratio (OR) = 1.34) and for ETV6-RUNX1 fusion-positive BCP-ALL at 2q22.3 (rs17481869, P = 3.20 × 10(-8), OR = 2.14). Our findings provide further insights into genetic susceptibility to ALL and its biology.	
29632382	Refining the accuracy of validated target identification through coding variant fine-mapping in type 2 diabetes.	We aggregated coding variant data for 81,412 type 2 diabetes cases and 370,832 controls of diverse ancestry, identifying 40 coding variant association signals (P < 2.2 × 10(-7)); of these, 16 map outside known risk-associated loci. We make two important observations. First, only five of these signals are driven by low-frequency variants: even for these, effect sizes are modest (odds ratio ≤1.29). Second, when we used large-scale genome-wide association data to fine-map the associated variants in their regional context, accounting for the global enrichment of complex trait associations in coding sequence, compelling evidence for coding variant causality was obtained for only 16 signals. At 13 others, the associated coding variants clearly represent 'false leads' with potential to generate erroneous mechanistic inference. Coding variant associations offer a direct route to biological insight for complex diseases and identification of validated therapeutic targets; however, appropriate mechanistic inference requires careful specification of their causal contribution to disease predisposition.	
29631575	The genetics of smoking in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Smoking is the principal modifiable environmental risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which affects 300 million people and is the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide. Most of the genetic studies of smoking have relied on self-reported smoking status which is vulnerable to reporting and recall bias. Using data from the Lung Health Study (LHS), we sought to identify genetic variants associated with quantitative smoking and cessation in individuals with mild to moderate COPD. The LHS is a longitudinal multicenter study of mild-to-moderate COPD subjects who were all smokers at recruitment. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for salivary cotinine (n = 4024), exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) (n = 2854), cigarettes per day (CPD) (n = 2706) and smoking cessation at year 5 follow-up (n = 717 quitters and 2175 smokers). The GWAS analyses were adjusted for age, gender, and genetic principal components. For cotinine levels, SNPs near UGT2B10 gene achieved genome-wide significance (i.e. P < 5 × 10(- 8)) with top SNP rs10023464, P = 1.27 × 10(- 11). For eCO levels, one significant SNP was identified which mapped to the CHRNA3 gene (rs12914385, P = 2.38 × 10(- 8)). A borderline region mapping to KCNMA1 gene was associated with smoking cessation (rs207675, P = 5.95 × 10(- 8)). Of the identified loci, only the CHRNA3/5 locus showed significant associations with lung function but only in heavy smokers. No regions met genome-wide significance for CPD. The study demonstrates that using objective measures of smoking such as eCO and/or salivary cotinine can more precisely capture the genetic contribution to multiple aspects of smoking behaviour. The KCNMA1 gene association with smoking cessation may represent a potential therapeutic target and warrants further studies. The Lung Health Study ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000568 . Date of registration: October 28, 1999.	
30134803	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel loci associated with parathyroid hormone level.	Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is one of the principal regulators of calcium homeostasis. Although serum PTH level is mostly accounted by genetic factors, genetic background underlying PTH level is insufficiently known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify novel genetic variants associated with PTH levels. We performed GWAS meta-analysis within two genetically isolated Croatian populations followed by replication analysis in a Croatian mainland population and we also combined results across all three analyzed populations. The analyses included 2596 individuals. A total of 7,411,206 variants, imputed using the 1000 Genomes reference panel, were analysed for the association. In addition, a sex-specific GWAS meta-analyses were performed. Polymorphisms with the lowest P-values were located on chromosome 4 approximately 84 kb of the 5' of RASGEF1B gene. The most significant SNP was rs11099476 (P = 1.15 × 10(-8)). Sex-specific analysis identified genome-wide significant association of the variant rs77178854, located within DPP10 gene in females only (P = 2.21 × 10(- 9)). There were no genome-wide significant findings in the meta-analysis of males. We identified two biologically plausible novel loci associated with PTH levels, providing us with further insights into the genetics of this complex trait.	
29659830	Genome-wide association study identifies nine novel loci for 2D:4D finger ratio, a putative retrospective biomarker of testosterone exposure in utero.	The ratio of the length of the index finger to that of the ring finger (2D:4D) is sexually dimorphic and is commonly used as a non-invasive biomarker of prenatal androgen exposure. Most association studies of 2D:4D ratio with a diverse range of sex-specific traits have typically involved small sample sizes and have been difficult to replicate, raising questions around the utility and precise meaning of the measure. In the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of 2D:4D ratio to date (N = 15 661, with replication N = 75 821), we identified 11 loci (9 novel) explaining 3.8% of the variance in mean 2D:4D ratio. We also found weak evidence for association (β = 0.06; P = 0.02) between 2D:4D ratio and sensitivity to testosterone [length of the CAG microsatellite repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene] in females only. Furthermore, genetic variants associated with (adult) testosterone levels and/or sex hormone-binding globulin were not associated with 2D:4D ratio in our sample. Although we were unable to find strong evidence from our genetic study to support the hypothesis that 2D:4D ratio is a direct biomarker of prenatal exposure to androgens in healthy individuals, our findings do not explicitly exclude this possibility, and pathways involving testosterone may become apparent as the size of the discovery sample increases further. Our findings provide new insight into the underlying biology shaping 2D:4D variation in the general population.	
29650774	Genetic Variants in 	Metformin is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although widely prescribed, the glucose-lowering mechanism for metformin is incompletely understood. Here, we used a genome-wide association approach in a diverse group of individuals with T2D from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial to identify common and rare variants associated with HbA(1c) response to metformin treatment and followed up these findings in four replication cohorts. Common variants in(PRPF31) and(CPA6) were associated with worse and better metformin response, respectively ((P) < 5 × 10(-6)), and meta-analysis in independent cohorts displayed similar associations with metformin response ((P) = 1.2 × 10(-8) and(P) = 0.005, respectively). Previous studies have shown that(PRPF31)(+/-) knockout mice have increased total body fat ((P) = 1.78 × 10(-6)) and increased fasted circulating glucose ((P) = 5.73 × 10(-6)). Furthermore, rare variants in(STAT3) associated with worse metformin response ((q) <0.1). STAT3 is a ubiquitously expressed pleiotropic transcriptional activator that participates in the regulation of metabolism and feeding behavior. Here, we provide novel evidence for associations of common and rare variants in(PRPF31, CPA6,) and(STAT3) with metformin response that may provide insight into mechanisms important for metformin efficacy in T2D.	
29674289	Novel association between CDKAL1 and cholesterol efflux capacity: Replication after GWAS-based discovery.	Although the importance of the functional properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been increasingly emphasized, studies on the genetic factors associated with HDL function are highly limited. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants associated with an individual's cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) using a genome-wide association study approach. This study included a discovery group of 607 subjects with coronary artery disease and an independent replication group of 158 subjects. CEC was assessed using a radioisotope and ApoB-depleted serum. Genome-wide associations between the adjusted CEC and genotyped and imputed variants were examined with linear regression, assuming an additive genetic model. Finally, adjustments were made for confounding parameters to assess the independence of associations and to determine R(2) of overall model on CEC. In the discovery group, 631 variants showed significant association with CEC, and five of them were found to correlate with CEC in the replication group. One of them was located near LOC541471 in 2q13, whereas the other four (rs117835232, rs117252933, rs118064592, and rs150434350) were located in CDKAL1 in 6p22.3. The association between the presence of any CDKAL1 variant and CEC was significant after adjustment for clinical and laboratory variables. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels also showed a very significant association with CEC. Body mass index, current alcohol use, triglycerides levels, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels and statin use showed borderline associations with CEC. We identified and replicated genetic variants associated with CEC using a genome-wide association study-based approach. CDKAL1 variants showed correlations with CEC independent of HDL-cholesterol levels and other clinical characteristics.	
29654602	A genome wide association study identifies new genes potentially associated with eyelid sagging.	Sagging eyelid is considered as an outward of skin ageing and may cause medical issues. However, little is known about the factors involved in sagging eyelid. The study, which aims at determining genetic risk factors for eyelid sagging, was conducted in a cohort of 502 unrelated Caucasian women living in the Paris region. All included participants were aged between 44 and 70 years old (mean age, 57.6 years old). The severity of sagging eyelid was graded in 6 categories by a dermatologist using standardized photographs of the face. A genome wide association study adjusted on potential risk factors (including age and smoking habits) was conducted to identify genetic associations. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in total linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 10, rs16927253 (P = 7.07 × 10(-10) ) and rs4746957 (P = 1.06 × 10(-8) ), were significantly associated with eyelid sagging severity. The rs16927253-T and rs4746957-A alleles showed a dominant protective effect towards eyelid sagging. These polymorphisms are located in intronic parts of the H2AFY2 gene which encodes a member of the H2A histone family and very close to the AIFM2 gene that induces apoptosis. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms with a false discovery rate below 0.25 were located nearby the type XIII collagen COL13A1 gene on chromosome 10 and in the ADAMTS18 gene on chromosome 16. Several relevant genes were identified by the genome wide association study for their potential role in the sagging eyelid severity.	
29884306	Genetic variations and risk of placental abruption: A genome-wide association study and meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.	Accumulating epidemiological evidence points to strong genetic susceptibility to placental abruption (PA). However, characterization of genes associated with PA remains incomplete. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PA and a meta-analysis of GWAS. Participants of the Placental Abruption Genetic Epidemiology (PAGE) study, a population based case-control study of PA conducted in Lima, Peru, were genotyped using the Illumina HumanCore-24 BeadChip platform. Genotypes were imputed using the 1000 genomes reference panel, and >4.9 million SNPs that passed quality control were analyzed. We performed a GWAS in PAGE participants (507 PA cases and 1090 controls) and a GWAS meta-analysis in 2512 participants (959 PA cases and 1553 controls) that included PAGE and the previously reported Peruvian Abruptio Placentae Epidemiology (PAPE) study. We fitted population stratification-adjusted logistic regression models and fixed-effects meta-analyses using inverse-variance weighting. Independent loci (linkage-disequilibrium<0.80) suggestively associated with PA (P-value<5e-5) included rs4148646 and rs2074311 in ABCC8, rs7249210, rs7250184, rs7249100 and rs10401828 in ZNF28, rs11133659 in CTNND2, and rs2074314 and rs35271178 near KCNJ11 in the PAGE GWAS. Similarly, independent loci suggestively associated with PA in the GWAS meta-analysis included rs76258369 near IRX1, and rs7094759 and rs12264492 in ADAM12. Functional analyses of these genes showed trophoblast-like cell interaction, as well as networks involved in endocrine system disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cellular function. We identified several genetic loci and related functions that may play a role in PA risk. Understanding genetic factors underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PA may facilitate prevention and early diagnostic efforts.	
29662059	Genome-wide association study of depression phenotypes in UK Biobank identifies variants in excitatory synaptic pathways.	Depression is a polygenic trait that causes extensive periods of disability. Previous genetic studies have identified common risk variants which have progressively increased in number with increasing sample sizes of the respective studies. Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study in 322,580 UK Biobank participants for three depression-related phenotypes: broad depression, probable major depressive disorder (MDD), and International Classification of Diseases (ICD, version 9 or 10)-coded MDD. We identify 17 independent loci that are significantly associated (P < 5 × 10(-8)) across the three phenotypes. The direction of effect of these loci is consistently replicated in an independent sample, with 14 loci likely representing novel findings. Gene sets are enriched in excitatory neurotransmission, mechanosensory behaviour, post synapse, neuron spine and dendrite functions. Our findings suggest that broad depression is the most tractable UK Biobank phenotype for discovering genes and gene sets that further our understanding of the biological pathways underlying depression.	
29662168	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of individuals of European ancestry identifies new loci explaining a substantial fraction of hair color variation and heritability.	Hair color is one of the most recognizable visual traits in European populations and is under strong genetic control. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of almost 300,000 participants of European descent. We identified 123 autosomal and one X-chromosome loci significantly associated with hair color; all but 13 are novel. Collectively, single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with hair color within these loci explain 34.6% of red hair, 24.8% of blond hair, and 26.1% of black hair heritability in the study populations. These results confirm the polygenic nature of complex phenotypes and improve our understanding of melanin pigment metabolism in humans.	
29679657	Eleven loci with new reproducible genetic associations with allergic disease risk.	A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 99 loci that contain genetic risk variants shared between asthma, hay fever, and eczema. Many more risk loci shared between these common allergic diseases remain to be discovered, which could point to new therapeutic opportunities. We sought to identify novel risk loci shared between asthma, hay fever, and eczema by applying a gene-based test of association to results from a published GWAS that included data from 360,838 subjects. We used approximate conditional analysis to adjust the results from the published GWAS for the effects of the top risk variants identified in that study. We then analyzed the adjusted GWAS results with the EUGENE gene-based approach, which combines evidence for association with disease risk across regulatory variants identified in different tissues. Novel gene-based associations were followed up in an independent sample of 233,898 subjects from the UK Biobank study. Of the 19,432 genes tested, 30 had a significant gene-based association at a Bonferroni-corrected P value of 2.5 × 10(-6). Of these, 20 were also significantly associated (P < .05/30 = .0016) with disease risk in the replication sample, including 19 that were located in 11 loci not reported to contain allergy risk variants in previous GWASs. Among these were 9 genes with a known function that is directly relevant to allergic disease: FOSL2, VPRBP, IPCEF1, PRR5L, NCF4, APOBR, IL27, ATXN2L, and LAT. For 4 genes (eg, ATXN2L), a genetically determined decrease in gene expression was associated with decreased allergy risk, and therefore drugs that inhibit gene expression or function are predicted to ameliorate disease symptoms. The opposite directional effect was observed for 14 genes, including IL27, a cytokine known to suppress T(H)2 responses. Using a gene-based approach, we identified 11 risk loci for allergic disease that were not reported in previous GWASs. Functional studies that investigate the contribution of the 19 associated genes to the pathophysiology of allergic disease and assess their therapeutic potential are warranted.	
29673008	A GWAS meta-analysis from 5 population-based cohorts implicates ion channel genes in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome.	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) shows genetic predisposition, however, large-scale, powered gene mapping studies are lacking. We sought to exploit existing genetic (genotype) and epidemiological (questionnaire) data from a series of population-based cohorts for IBS genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and their meta-analysis. Based on questionnaire data compatible with Rome III Criteria, we identified a total of 1335 IBS cases and 9768 asymptomatic individuals from 5 independent European genotyped cohorts. Individual GWAS were carried out with sex-adjusted logistic regression under an additive model, followed by meta-analysis using the inverse variance method. Functional annotation of significant results was obtained via a computational pipeline exploiting ontology and interaction networks, and tissue-specific and gene set enrichment analyses. Suggestive GWAS signals (P ≤ 5.0 × 10(-6) ) were detected for 7 genomic regions, harboring 64 gene candidates to affect IBS risk via functional or expression changes. Functional annotation of this gene set convincingly (best FDR-corrected P = 3.1 × 10(-10) ) highlighted regulation of ion channel activity as the most plausible pathway affecting IBS risk. Our results confirm the feasibility of population-based studies for gene-discovery efforts in IBS, identify risk genes and loci to be prioritized in independent follow-ups, and pinpoint ion channels as important players and potential therapeutic targets warranting further investigation.	
29682794	Genetic associations with childhood brain growth, defined in two longitudinal cohorts.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are unraveling the genetics of adult brain neuroanatomy as measured by cross-sectional anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI). However, the genetic mechanisms that shape childhood brain development are, as yet, largely unexplored. In this study we identify common genetic variants associated with childhood brain development as defined by longitudinal aMRI. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were determined in two cohorts: one enriched for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (LONG cohort: 458 participants; 119 with ADHD) and the other from a population-based cohort (Generation R: 257 participants). The growth of the brain's major regions (cerebral cortex, white matter, basal ganglia, and cerebellum) and one region of interest (the right lateral prefrontal cortex) were defined on all individuals from two aMRIs, and a GWAS and a pathway analysis were performed. In addition, association between polygenic risk for ADHD and brain growth was determined for the LONG cohort. For white matter growth, GWAS meta-analysis identified a genome-wide significant intergenic SNP (rs12386571, P = 9.09 × 10(-9) ), near AKR1B10. This gene is part of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily and shows neural expression. No enrichment of neural pathways was detected and polygenic risk for ADHD was not associated with the brain growth phenotypes in the LONG cohort that was enriched for the diagnosis of ADHD. The study illustrates the use of a novel brain growth phenotype defined in vivo for further study.	
29691431	Biological Insights Into Muscular Strength: Genetic Findings in the UK Biobank.	We performed a large genome-wide association study to discover genetic variation associated with muscular strength, and to evaluate shared genetic aetiology with and causal effects of muscular strength on several health indicators. In our discovery analysis of 223,315 individuals, we identified 101 loci associated with grip strength (P <5 × 10(-8)). Of these, 64 were associated (P < 0.01 and consistent direction) also in the replication dataset (N = 111,610). eQTL analyses highlighted several genes known to play a role in neuro-developmental disorders or brain function, and the results from meta-analysis showed a significant enrichment of gene expression of brain-related transcripts. Further, we observed inverse genetic correlations of grip strength with cardiometabolic traits, and positive correlation with parents' age of death and education. We also showed that grip strength had shared biological pathways with indicators of frailty, including cognitive performance scores. By use of Mendelian randomization, we provide evidence that higher grip strength is protective of both coronary heart disease (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.79, P < 0.0001) and atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90, P = 0.003). In conclusion, our results show shared genetic aetiology between grip strength, and cardiometabolic and cognitive health; and suggest that maintaining muscular strength could prevent future cardiovascular events.	
29691896	Genome-wide interaction with the insulin secretion locus MTNR1B reveals CMIP as a novel type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene in African Americans.	Although type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from metabolic defects in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, most of the genetic risk loci identified to date relates to insulin secretion. We reported that T2D loci influencing insulin sensitivity may be identified through interactions with insulin secretion loci, thereby leading to T2D. Here, we hypothesize that joint testing of variant main effects and interaction effects with an insulin secretion locus increases power to identify genetic interactions leading to T2D. We tested this hypothesis with an intronic MTNR1B SNP, rs10830963, which is associated with acute insulin response to glucose, a dynamic measure of insulin secretion. rs10830963 was tested for interaction and joint (main + interaction) effects with genome-wide data in African Americans (2,452 cases and 3,772 controls) from five cohorts. Genome-wide genotype data (Affymetrix Human Genome 6.0 array) was imputed to a 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. T2D risk was modeled using logistic regression with rs10830963 dosage, age, sex, and principal component as predictors. Joint effects were captured using the Kraft two degrees of freedom test. Genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10(-8) ) interaction with MTNR1B and joint effects were detected for CMIP intronic SNP rs17197883 (P(interaction ) = 1.43 × 10(-8) ; P(joint ) = 4.70 × 10(-8) ). CMIP variants have been nominally associated with T2D, fasting glucose, and adiponectin in individuals of East Asian ancestry, with high-density lipoprotein, and with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index in Europeans. These data support the hypothesis that additional genetic factors contributing to T2D risk, including insulin sensitivity loci, can be identified through interactions with insulin secretion loci.	
29695241	Novel risk genes identified in a genome-wide association study for coronary artery disease in patients with type 1 diabetes.	Patients with type 1 diabetes are more at risk of coronary artery disease than the general population. Although evidence points to a genetic risk there have been no study investigating genetic risk factors of coronary artery disease specific to individuals with type 1 diabetes. To identify low frequency and common genetic variations associated with coronary artery disease in populations of individuals with type 1 diabetes. A two-stage genome wide association study was conducted. The discovery phase involved the meta-analysis of three genome-wide association cohorts totaling 434 patients with type 1 diabetes and coronary artery disease (cases) and 3123 T1D individuals with no evidence of coronary artery disease (controls). Replication of the top association signals (p < 10(-5)) was performed in five additional independent cohorts totaling 585 cases and 2612 controls. One locus (rs115829748, located upstream of the MAP1B gene) reached the statistical threshold of 5 × 10(-8) for genome-wide significance but did not replicate. Nevertheless, three single nucleotide polymorphisms provided suggestive evidence for association with coronary artery disease in the combined studies: CDK18 rs138760780 (OR = 2.60 95% confidence interval [1.75-3.85], p = 2.02 × 10(-6)), FAM189A2 rs12344245 (OR = 1.85 [1.41-2.43], p = 8.52 × 10(-6)) and PKD1 rs116092985 (OR = 1.53 [1.27-1.85], p = 1.01 × 10(-5)). In addition, our analyses suggested that genetic variations at the ANKS1A, COL4A2 and APOE loci previously found associated with coronary artery disease in the general population could have stronger effects in patients with type 1 diabetes. This study suggests three novel candidate genes for coronary artery disease in the subgroup of patients affected with type 1 diabetes. The detected associations deserve to be definitively validated in additional epidemiological studies.	
29698431	Mapping genetic variants for cranial vault shape in humans.	The shape of the cranial vault, a region comprising interlocking flat bones surrounding the cerebral cortex, varies considerably in humans. Strongly influenced by brain size and shape, cranial vault morphology has both clinical and evolutionary relevance. However, little is known about the genetic basis of normal vault shape in humans. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on three vault measures (maximum cranial width [MCW], maximum cranial length [MCL], and cephalic index [CI]) in a sample of 4419 healthy individuals of European ancestry. All measures were adjusted by sex, age, and body size, then tested for association with genetic variants spanning the genome. GWAS results for the two cohorts were combined via meta-analysis. Significant associations were observed at two loci: 15p11.2 (lead SNP rs2924767, p = 2.107 × 10-8) for MCW and 17q11.2 (lead SNP rs72841279, p = 5.29 × 10-9) for MCL. Additionally, 32 suggestive loci (p < 5x10-6) were observed. Several candidate genes were located in these loci, such as NLK, MEF2A, SOX9 and SOX11. Genome-wide linkage analysis of cranial vault shape in mice (N = 433) was performed to follow-up the associated candidate loci identified in the human GWAS. Two loci, 17q11.2 (c11.loc44 in mice) and 17q25.1 (c11.loc74 in mice), associated with cranial vault size in humans, were also linked with cranial vault size in mice (LOD scores: 3.37 and 3.79 respectively). These results provide further insight into genetic pathways and mechanisms underlying normal variation in human craniofacial morphology.	
29698419	Genetic susceptibility markers for a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype: Exploratory results from genome-wide association studies.	Clustering of breast and colorectal cancer has been observed within some families and cannot be explained by chance or known high-risk mutations in major susceptibility genes. Potential shared genetic susceptibility between breast and colorectal cancer, not explained by high-penetrance genes, has been postulated. We hypothesized that yet undiscovered genetic variants predispose to a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype. To identify variants associated with a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, we analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from cases and controls that met the following criteria: cases (n = 985) were women with breast cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with colorectal cancer, men/women with colorectal cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer, and women diagnosed with both breast and colorectal cancer. Controls (n = 1769), were unrelated, breast and colorectal cancer-free, and age- and sex- frequency-matched to cases. After imputation, 6,220,060 variants were analyzed using the discovery set and variants associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype at P<5.0E-04 (n = 549, at 60 loci) were analyzed for replication (n = 293 cases and 2,103 controls). Multiple correlated SNPs in intron 1 of the ROBO1 gene were suggestively associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype in the discovery and replication data (most significant; rs7430339, Pdiscovery = 1.2E-04; rs7429100, Preplication = 2.8E-03). In meta-analysis of the discovery and replication data, the most significant association remained at rs7429100 (P = 1.84E-06). The results of this exploratory analysis did not find clear evidence for a susceptibility locus with a pleiotropic effect on hereditary breast and colorectal cancer risk, although the suggestive association of genetic variation in the region of ROBO1, a potential tumor suppressor gene, merits further investigation.	
29700475	Genome-wide association analyses identify 44 risk variants and refine the genetic architecture of major depression.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common illness accompanied by considerable morbidity, mortality, costs, and heightened risk of suicide. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression. These findings help refine the basis of major depression and imply that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.	
29728651	Common variants on 6q16.2, 12q24.31 and 16p13.3 are associated with major depressive disorder.	Accumulating evidence suggests that genetic factors have a role in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, only limited MDD risk loci have been identified so far. Here we perform a meta-analysis (a total of 90,150 MDD cases and 246,603 controls) through combing three genome-wide association studies of MDD, including 23andMe (cases were self-reported with a clinical diagnosis or treatment of depression), CONVERGE (cases were diagnosed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview) and PGC (cases were diagnosed using direct structured diagnostic interview (by trained interviewers) or clinician-administered DSM-IV checklists). Genetic variants from two previously unreported loci (rs10457592 on 6q16.2 and rs2004910 on 12q24.31) showed significant associations with MDD (P < 5 × 10(-8)) in a total of 336,753 subjects. SNPs (a total of 171) with a P < 1 × 10(-7) in the meta-analysis were further replicated in an independent sample (GS:SFHS, 2,659 MDD cases (diagnosed with DSM-IV) and 17,237 controls) and one additional risk locus (rs3785234 on 16p13.3, P = 1.57 × 10(-8)) was identified in the combined samples (a total of 92,809 cases and 263,840 controls). Risk variants on the identified risk loci were associated with gene expression in human brain tissues and mRNA expression analysis showed that FBXL4 and RSRC1 were significantly upregulated in brains of MDD cases compared with controls, suggesting that genetic variants may confer risk of MDD through regulating the expression of these two genes. Our study identified three novel risk loci (6q16.2, 12q24.31, and 16p13.3) for MDD and suggested that FBXL4 and RSRC1 may play a role in MDD. Further functional characterization of the identified risk genes may provide new insights for MDD pathogenesis.	
29703844	A Genome-Wide Association Study of Diabetic Kidney Disease in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes.	Identification of sequence variants robustly associated with predisposition to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has the potential to provide insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of DKD in type 2 diabetes (T2D) using eight complementary dichotomous and quantitative DKD phenotypes: the principal dichotomous analysis involved 5,717 T2D subjects, 3,345 with DKD. Promising association signals were evaluated in up to 26,827 subjects with T2D (12,710 with DKD). A combined T1D+T2D GWAS was performed using complementary data available for subjects with T1D, which, with replication samples, involved up to 40,340 subjects with diabetes (18,582 with DKD). Analysis of specific DKD phenotypes identified a novel signal near(GABRR1) (rs9942471,(P) = 4.5 × 10(-8)) associated with microalbuminuria in European T2D case subjects. However, no replication of this signal was observed in Asian subjects with T2D or in the equivalent T1D analysis. There was only limited support, in this substantially enlarged analysis, for association at previously reported DKD signals, except for those at(UMOD) and(PRKAG2), both associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that, despite challenges in addressing phenotypic heterogeneity, access to increased sample sizes will continue to provide more robust inference regarding risk variant discovery for DKD.	
29703947	Human brain arousal in the resting state: a genome-wide association study.	Arousal affects cognition, emotion, and behavior and has been implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Although environmental conditions substantially contribute to the level of arousal, stable interindividual characteristics are well-established and a genetic basis has been suggested. Here we investigated the molecular genetics of brain arousal in the resting state by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We selected N = 1877 participants from the population-based LIFE-Adult cohort. Participants underwent a 20-min eyes-closed resting state EEG, which was analyzed using the computerized VIGALL 2.1 (Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig). At the SNP-level, GWAS analyses revealed no genome-wide significant locus (p < 5E-8), although seven loci were suggestive (p < 1E-6). The strongest hit was an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of TMEM159 (lead-SNP: rs79472635, p = 5.49E-8). Importantly, at the gene-level, GWAS analyses revealed significant evidence for TMEM159 (p = 0.013, Bonferroni-corrected). By mapping our SNPs to the GWAS results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we found that all corresponding markers of TMEM159 showed nominally significant associations with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; 0.006 ≤ p ≤ 0.011). More specifically, variants associated with high arousal levels have previously been linked to an increased risk for MDD. In line with this, the MetaXcan database suggests increased expression levels of TMEM159 in MDD, as well as Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Alzheimer's Disease. Furthermore, our pathway analyses provided evidence for a role of sodium/calcium exchangers in resting state arousal. In conclusion, the present GWAS identifies TMEM159 as a novel candidate gene which may modulate the risk for psychiatric disorders through arousal mechanisms. Our results also encourage the elaboration of the previously reported interrelations between ion-channel modulators, sleep-wake behavior, and psychiatric disorders.	
29724592	Potential genetic modifiers of disease risk and age at onset in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and GRN mutations: a genome-wide association study.	Loss-of-function mutations in GRN cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Patients with GRN mutations present with a uniform subtype of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology at autopsy (FTLD-TDP type A); however, age at onset and clinical presentation are variable, even within families. We aimed to identify potential genetic modifiers of disease onset and disease risk in GRN mutation carriers. The study was done in three stages: a discovery stage, a replication stage, and a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication data. In the discovery stage, genome-wide logistic and linear regression analyses were done to test the association of genetic variants with disease risk (case or control status) and age at onset in patients with a GRN mutation and controls free of neurodegenerative disorders. Suggestive loci (p<1 × 10(-5)) were genotyped in a replication cohort of patients and controls, followed by a meta-analysis. The effect of genome-wide significant variants at the GFRA2 locus on expression of GFRA2 was assessed using mRNA expression studies in cerebellar tissue samples from the Mayo Clinic brain bank. The effect of the GFRA2 locus on progranulin concentrations was studied using previously generated ELISA-based expression data. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells were done to test for a direct interaction between GFRA2 and progranulin. Individuals were enrolled in the current study between Sept 16, 2014, and Oct 5, 2017. After quality control measures, statistical analyses in the discovery stage included 382 unrelated symptomatic GRN mutation carriers and 1146 controls free of neurodegenerative disorders collected from 34 research centres located in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. In the replication stage, 210 patients (67 symptomatic GRN mutation carriers and 143 patients with FTLD without GRN mutations pathologically confirmed as FTLD-TDP type A) and 1798 controls free of neurodegenerative diseases were recruited from 26 sites, 20 of which overlapped with the discovery stage. No genome-wide significant association with age at onset was identified in the discovery or replication stages, or in the meta-analysis. However, in the case-control analysis, we replicated the previously reported TMEM106B association (rs1990622 meta-analysis odds ratio [OR] 0·54, 95% CI 0·46-0·63; p=3·54 × 10(-16)), and identified a novel genome-wide significant locus at GFRA2 on chromosome 8p21.3 associated with disease risk (rs36196656 meta-analysis OR 1·49, 95% CI 1·30-1·71; p=1·58 × 10(-8)). Expression analyses showed that the risk-associated allele at rs36196656 decreased GFRA2 mRNA concentrations in cerebellar tissue (p=0·04). No effect of rs36196656 on plasma and CSF progranulin concentrations was detected by ELISA; however, co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells did suggest a direct binding of progranulin and GFRA2. TMEM106B-related and GFRA2-related pathways might be future targets for treatments for FTLD, but the biological interaction between progranulin and these potential disease modifiers requires further study. TMEM106B and GFRA2 might also provide opportunities to select and stratify patients for future clinical trials and, when more is known about their potential effects, to inform genetic counselling, especially for asymptomatic individuals.

29847655	Family-Based Genome-Wide Association Study of South Indian Pedigrees Supports WNT7B as a Central Corneal Thickness Locus.	To identify genetic risk factors contributing to central corneal thickness (CCT) in individuals from South India, a population with a high prevalence of ocular disorders. One hundred ninety-five individuals from 15 large South Indian pedigrees were genotyped using the Omni2.5 bead array. Family-based association for CCT was conducted using the score test in MERLIN. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified strongest association for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first intron of WNT7B and CCT (top SNP rs9330813; β = -0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.78 to -0.36; P = 1.7 × 10-7). We further investigated rs9330813 in a Latino cohort and four independent European cohorts. A meta-analysis of these data sets demonstrated statistically significant association between rs9330813 and CCT (β = -3.94, 95% CI: -5.23 to -2.66; P = 1.7 × 10-9). WNT7B SNPs located in the same genomic region that includes rs9330813 have previously been associated with CCT in Latinos but with other ocular quantitative traits related to myopia (corneal curvature and axial length) in a Japanese population (rs10453441 and rs200329677). To evaluate the specificity of the observed WNT7B association with CCT in the South Indian families, we completed an ocular phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) for the top WNT7B SNPs using 45 ocular traits measured in these same families including corneal curvature and axial length. The ocular PheWAS results indicate that in the South Indian families WNT7B SNPs are primarily associated with CCT. The results indicate robust evidence for association between WNT7B SNPs and CCT in South Indian pedigrees, and suggest that WNT7B SNPs can have population-specific effects on ocular quantitative traits.	
29728394	CETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein) Concentration: A Genome-Wide Association Study Followed by Mendelian Randomization on Coronary Artery Disease.	We aimed to identify independent genetic determinants of circulating CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) to assess causal effects of variation in CETP concentration on circulating lipid concentrations and cardiovascular disease risk. A genome-wide association discovery and replication study on serum CETP concentration were embedded in the NEO study (Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity). Based on the independent identified variants, Mendelian randomization was conducted on serum lipids (NEO study) and coronary artery disease (CAD; CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium). In the discovery analysis (n=4248), we identified 3 independent variants ((P)<5×10(-8)) that determine CETP concentration. These single-nucleotide polymorphisms were mapped to(CETP) and replicated in a separate subpopulation (n=1458). Per-allele increase (SE) in serum CETP was 0.32 (0.02) µg/mL for rs247616-C, 0.35 (0.02) µg/mL for rs12720922-A, and 0.12 (0.02) µg/mL for rs1968905-G. Combined, these 3 variants explained 16.4% of the total variation in CETP concentration. One microgram per milliliter increase in genetically determined CETP concentration strongly decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.23 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval, -0.26 to -0.20), moderately increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.08 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.16), and was associated with an odds ratio of 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.23) for CAD risk. This is the first genome-wide association study identifying independent variants that largely determine CETP concentration. Although high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is not a causal risk factor for CAD, it has been unequivocally demonstrated that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering is proportionally associated with a lower CAD risk. Therefore, the results of our study are fully consistent with the notion that CETP concentration is causally associated with CAD through low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.	
29748315	Genetic Regulation of PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9) Plasma Levels and Its Impact on Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease Phenotypes.	Inhibition of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is a novel strategy to treat hypercholesterolemia and reduce cardiovascular events. However, the potential role of circulating plasma PCSK9 concentrations as a diagnostic and predictive biomarker remains uncertain as of now. Here, we aimed to identify genetic variants associated with plasma PCSK9 and investigate possible causal effects on atherosclerotic vascular disease phenotypes. We performed the first genome-wide association study of plasma PCSK9 levels in a cohort of suspected and confirmed coronary artery disease (LIFE-Heart; n=3290). Several independent variants at the(PCSK9) gene locus were associated with circulating PCSK9 levels at genome-wide significance (lead SNP rs11591147, PCSK9-R46L;(P)=1.94×10(-17)). We discovered 4 independent(PCSK9) SNPs explaining 4.4% of the variance of plasma PCSK9. In addition, we identified a genome-wide significant locus at chromosome 7p22.1 (rs6957201;(P)=7.01×10(-9)) and 7 suggestive hits ((P)<1×10(-6)). Using MR (Mendelian Randomization), we detected significant causal effects of circulating PCSK9 on coronary artery disease status and severity, carotid plaques, and intima-media thickness. Variants at the(PCSK9) gene locus seem to be the major genetic determinants of plasma PCSK9 levels with 4 independent variants at the(PCSK9) gene locus expressing allelic heterogeneity. The detected MR estimates support the hypothesis of a causal effect of PCSK9 on coronary artery disease and other vascular phenotypes. Other observed genetic associations for PCSK9 require validation in independent cohorts. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique Identifier: NCT00497887.	
29730043	Identifying the genetic risk factors for treatment response to lurasidone by genome-wide association study: A meta-analysis of samples from three independent clinical trials.	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of response of schizophrenia patients to the atypical antipsychotic drug, lurasidone, based on two double-blind registration trials, identified SNPs from four classes of genes as predictors of efficacy, but none were genome wide significant (GWS). After inclusion of data from a third lurasidone trial, meta-analysis identified a GWS marker and other findings consistent with our first study. The primary end-point was change in Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) between baseline and last observation carried forward. rs4736253, a genetic locus near KCNK9, encoding the K(2P)9.1 potassium channel, with a role in cognition and neurodevelopment, was the top marker in patients of European ancestry (EUR) (n = 264), reaching GWS (p = 4.78 × 10(-8)). rs10180106 (p = 4.92 × 10(-7)), located at an intron region of CTNNA2, a SCZ risk gene important for dendritic spine stabilization, was one of other best response markers for EUR patients. SNPs at STXBP5L (rs511841, p = 2.63 × 10(-7)) were the top markers for patients of African ancestry (n = 158). The association between PTPRD, NRG1, and MAGI1 previously reported to be related to response to lurasidone in the first two trials, showed a trend of significant association in the third trial. None of these genetic loci showed significant associations with clinical response in the corresponding placebo groups (n = 107 for EUR; n = 58 for AFR). This meta-analysis yielded the first GWAS-based GWS biomarker for lurasidone response and additional support for the conclusion that genes related to synaptic biology and/or risk for SCZ are the strongest predictors of response to lurasidone in schizophrenia patients.	
29725004	CCDC102B confers risk of low vision and blindness in high myopia.	The incidence of high myopia is increasing worldwide with myopic maculopathy, a complication of myopia, often progressing to blindness. Our two-stage genome-wide association study of myopic maculopathy identifies a susceptibility locus at rs11873439 in an intron of CCDC102B (P = 1.77 × 10(-12) and P(corr) = 1.61 × 10(-10)). In contrast, this SNP is not significantly associated with myopia itself. The association between rs11873439 and myopic maculopathy is further confirmed in 2317 highly myopic patients (P = 2.40 × 10(-6) and P(corr) = 1.72 × 10(-4)). CCDC102B is strongly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and choroids, where atrophic changes initially occur in myopic maculopathy. The development of myopic maculopathy thus likely exhibits a unique background apart from the development of myopia itself; elucidation of the roles of CCDC102B in myopic maculopathy development may thus provide insights into preventive methods for blindness in patients with high myopia.	
29998114	Association of Novel ALX4 Gene Polymorphisms with Antidepressant Treatment Response: Findings from the CO-MED Trial.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted in participants of the CO-MED (Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes) trial, a randomized, 3-treatment arm clinical trial of major depressive disorder (MDD) designed to identify markers of differential treatment outcome (response and remission). The QIDS-SR (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Reported version) was used to measure response at week 6 (QIDS-SR ≤5) and remission at week 12 (QIDS-SR ≤6 and ≤8 at the last two study visits). Three treatment groups (escitalopram monotherapy, escitalopram + bupropion, and venlafaxine + mirtazapine) were evaluated. GWAS identified a potentially regulatory SNP rs10769025 in the ALX4 gene on chromosome 11 with a strong association ((p) value = 9.85925E-08) with response to escitalopram monotherapy in Caucasians. Further, haplotype analysis on 7 ALX4 variants showed that a regulatory haplotype CAAACTG was significantly associated (odds ratio = 3.4,(p) = 2.00E-04) with response to escitalopram monotherapy at week 6. Ingenuity pathway analyses in the present study suggest that ALX4 has an indirect connection with antidepressant gene pathways in MDD, which may account for the genetic association with treatment outcome. Functional genomics studies to investigate the role of ALX4 in antidepressant treatment outcome will be an interesting future direction.	
30271922	Genome-wide association study for risk taking propensity indicates shared pathways with body mass index.	Risk-taking propensity is a trait of significant public health relevance but few specific genetic factors are known. Here we perform a genome-wide association study of self-reported risk-taking propensity among 436,236 white European UK Biobank study participants. We identify genome-wide associations at 26 loci ((P) < 5 × 10(-8)), 24 of which are novel, implicating genes enriched in the GABA and GABA receptor pathways. Modelling the relationship between risk-taking propensity and body mass index (BMI) using Mendelian randomisation shows a positive association (0.25 approximate SDs of BMI (SE: 0.06);(P) = 6.7 × 10(-5)). The impact of individual SNPs is heterogeneous, indicating a complex relationship arising from multiple shared pathways. We identify positive genetic correlations between risk-taking and waist-hip ratio, childhood obesity, ever smoking, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, alongside a negative correlation with women's age at first birth. These findings highlight that behavioural pathways involved in risk-taking propensity may play a role in obesity, smoking and psychiatric disorders.	
29739929	Genome-wide association study in 176,678 Europeans reveals genetic loci for tanning response to sun exposure.	The skin's tendency to sunburn rather than tan is a major risk factor for skin cancer. Here we report a large genome-wide association study of ease of skin tanning in 176,678 subjects of European ancestry. We identify significant association with tanning ability at 20 loci. We confirm previously identified associations at six of these loci, and report 14 novel loci, of which ten have never been associated with pigmentation-related phenotypes. Our results also suggest that variants at the AHR/AGR3 locus, previously associated with cutaneous malignant melanoma the underlying mechanism of which is poorly understood, might act on disease risk through modulation of tanning ability.	
29738550	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of circulating odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids: Results from the CHARGE Consortium.	Odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids (OCSFA) have been associated with potential health benefits. Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established. To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (LCT) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels. We found no genome-wide significant evidence that common genetic variation is associated with circulating levels of C15:0 or C23:0. In two cohorts with available data, we identified one intronic SNP (rs13361131) in myosin X gene (MYO10) associated with C17:0 level (P = 1.37×10-8), and two intronic SNP (rs12874278 and rs17363566) in deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) region associated with C19:0 level (P = 7.07×10-9). In contrast, when using a candidate-gene approach, we found evidence that three SNPs in LCT (rs11884924, rs16832067, and rs3816088) are associated with circulating C17:0 level (adjusted P = 4×10-2). In addition, nine SNPs in the ceramide synthase 4 (CERS4) region were associated with circulating C23:0 levels (adjusted P<5×10-2). Our findings suggest that circulating levels of OCSFA may be predominantly influenced by non-genetic factors. SNPs associated with C17:0 level in the LCT gene may reflect genetic influence in dairy consumption or in metabolism of dairy foods. SNPs associated with C23:0 may reflect a role of genetic factors in the synthesis of sphingomyelin.	
29739359	Genome-wide association studies for diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.	Diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) are sight-threatening complications of diabetes mellitus and leading causes of adult-onset blindness worldwide. Genetic risk factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR) have been described previously, but have been difficult to replicate between studies, which have often used composite phenotypes and been conducted in different populations. This study aims to identify genetic risk factors for DME and PDR as separate complications in Australians of European descent with type 2 diabetes. Caucasian Australians with type 2 diabetes were evaluated in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to compare 270 DME cases and 176 PDR cases with 435 non-retinopathy controls. All participants were genotyped by SNP array and after data cleaning, cases were compared to controls using logistic regression adjusting for relevant covariates. The top ranked SNP for DME was rs1990145 (p = 4.10 × 10(- 6), OR = 2.02 95%CI [1.50, 2.72]) on chromosome 2. The top-ranked SNP for PDR was rs918519 (p = 3.87 × 10(- 6), OR = 0.35 95%CI [0.22, 0.54]) on chromosome 5. A trend towards association was also detected at two SNPs reported in the only other reported GWAS of DR in Caucasians; rs12267418 near MALRD1 (p = 0.008) in the DME cohort and rs16999051 in the diabetes gene PCSK2 (p = 0.007) in the PDR cohort. This study has identified loci of interest for DME and PDR, two common ocular complications of diabetes. These findings require replication in other Caucasian cohorts with type 2 diabetes and larger cohorts will be required to identify genetic loci with statistical confidence. There is considerable overlap in the patient cohorts with each retinopathy subtype, complicating the search for genes that contribute to PDR and DME biology.	
29743610	Sex-specific glioma genome-wide association study identifies new risk locus at 3p21.31 in females, and finds sex-differences in risk at 8q24.21.	Incidence of glioma is approximately 50% higher in males. Previous analyses have examined exposures related to sex hormones in women as potential protective factors for these tumors, with inconsistent results. Previous glioma genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not stratified by sex. Potential sex-specific genetic effects were assessed in autosomal SNPs and sex chromosome variants for all glioma, GBM and non-GBM patients using data from four previous glioma GWAS. Datasets were analyzed using sex-stratified logistic regression models and combined using meta-analysis. There were 4,831 male cases, 5,216 male controls, 3,206 female cases and 5,470 female controls. A significant association was detected at rs11979158 (7p11.2) in males only. Association at rs55705857 (8q24.21) was stronger in females than in males. A large region on 3p21.31 was identified with significant association in females only. The identified differences in effect of risk variants do not fully explain the observed incidence difference in glioma by sex.	
29747637	Genome-wide association study identifies two loci influencing plasma neurofilament light levels.	Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) is a promising biomarker for Alzheimer disease (AD), which increases in the early stage of AD and is associated with the progression of AD. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma NFL in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort to identify novel variants associated with AD. This study included 179 cognitively healthy controls (HC), 176 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 172 patients with AD. All subjects were restricted to non-Hispanic Caucasian derived from the ADNI cohort and met all quality control (QC) criteria. Association of plasma NFL with the genetic variants was assessed using PLINK with an additive genetic model, i.e.dose-dependent effect of the minor alleles. The influence of a genetic variant associated with plasma NFL (rs7943454) on brain structure was further assessed using PLINK with a linear regression model. The minor allele (T) of rs7943454 in leucine zipper protein 2 gene (LUZP2) was associated with higher plasma NFL at suggestive levels (P = 1.39 × 10(- 6)) in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the minor allele (G) of rs640476 near GABRB2 was associated with lower plasma NFL at suggestive levels (P = 6.71 × 10(- 6)) in a dose-dependent effect in all diagnostic groups except the MCI group. Furthermore, the minor allele (T) of rs7943454 within LUZP2 increased the onset risk of AD (odds ratio = 1.547, confidence interval 95% = 1.018-2.351) and was associated with atrophy of right middle temporal gyrus in the whole cohort in the longitudinal study (P = 0.0234). GWAS found the associations of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7943454 and rs640476) with plasma NFL at suggestive levels. Rs7943454 in LUZP2 was associated with the onset risk of AD and atrophy of right middle temporal gyrusin the whole cohort. Using an endophenotype-based approach, we identified rs7943454 as a new AD risk locus.	
29752348	Genetic Study of White Matter Integrity in UK Biobank (N=8448) and the Overlap With Stroke, Depression, and Dementia.	Structural integrity of the white matter is a marker of cerebral small vessel disease, which is the major cause of vascular dementia and a quarter of all strokes. Genetic studies provide a way to obtain novel insights in the disease mechanism underlying cerebral small vessel disease. The aim was to identify common variants associated with microstructural integrity of the white matter and to elucidate the relationships of white matter structural integrity with stroke, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer disease. This genome-wide association analysis included 8448 individuals from UK Biobank-a population-based cohort study that recruited individuals from across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010, aged 40 to 69 years. Microstructural integrity was measured as fractional anisotropy- (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)-derived parameters on diffusion tensor images. White matter hyperintensity volumes (WMHV) were assessed on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. We identified 1 novel locus at genome-wide significance ((VCAN) [versican]: rs13164785;(P)=3.7×10(-18) for MD and rs67827860;(P)=1.3×10(-14) for FA). LD score regression showed a significant genome-wide correlation between FA, MD, and WMHV (FA-WMHV rG 0.39 [SE, 0.15]; MD-WMHV rG 0.56 [SE, 0.19]). In polygenic risk score analysis, FA, MD, and WMHV were significantly associated with lacunar stroke, MD with major depressive disorder, and WMHV with Alzheimer disease. Genetic variants within the(VCAN) gene may play a role in the mechanisms underlying microstructural integrity of the white matter in the brain measured as FA and MD. Mechanisms underlying white matter alterations are shared with cerebrovascular disease, and inherited differences in white matter microstructure impact on Alzheimer disease and major depressive disorder.	
29751835	Genome-wide association study identified ATP6V1H locus influencing cerebrospinal fluid BACE activity.	The activity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) is a potential diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer disease (AD). A total of 340 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI) database were included in this study with quality-controlled CSF BACE and genotype data. Association of CSF BACE with the genetic variants of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed using PLINK under the additive genetic model. The P values of all SNPs for CSF BACE were adjusted for multiple comparisons. One SNP (rs1481950) in the ATP6V1H gene reached genome-wide significance for associations with CSF BACE (P = 4.88 × 10(- 9)). The minor allele (G) of rs1481950 was associated with higher CSF BACE activity. Although seven SNPs in SNX31, RORA, CDH23, RGS20, LRRC4C, MAPK6PS1 and LOC105378355 did not reach genome-wide significance (P < 10(- 8)), they were identified as suggestive loci (P < 10(- 5)). This study identified rs1481950 within ATP6V1H influencing human CSF BACE activity, which indicated that ATP6V1H gene may play some roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.	
29750799	Population-specific genetic modification of Huntington's disease in Venezuela.	Modifiers of Mendelian disorders can provide insights into disease mechanisms and guide therapeutic strategies. A recent genome-wide association (GWA) study discovered genetic modifiers of Huntington's disease (HD) onset in Europeans. Here, we performed whole genome sequencing and GWA analysis of a Venezuelan HD cluster whose families were crucial for the original mapping of the HD gene defect. The Venezuelan HD subjects develop motor symptoms earlier than their European counterparts, implying the potential for population-specific modifiers. The main Venezuelan HD family inherits HTT haplotype hap.03, which differs subtly at the sequence level from European HD hap.03, suggesting a different ancestral origin but not explaining the earlier age at onset in these Venezuelans. GWA analysis of the Venezuelan HD cluster suggests both population-specific and population-shared genetic modifiers. Genome-wide significant signals at 7p21.2-21.1 and suggestive association signals at 4p14 and 17q21.2 are evident only in Venezuelan HD, but genome-wide significant association signals at the established European chromosome 15 modifier locus are improved when Venezuelan HD data are included in the meta-analysis. Venezuelan-specific association signals on chromosome 7 center on SOSTDC1, which encodes a bone morphogenetic protein antagonist. The corresponding SNPs are associated with reduced expression of SOSTDC1 in non-Venezuelan tissue samples, suggesting that interaction of reduced SOSTDC1 expression with a population-specific genetic or environmental factor may be responsible for modification of HD onset in Venezuela. Detection of population-specific modification in Venezuelan HD supports the value of distinct disease populations in revealing novel aspects of a disease and population-relevant therapeutic strategies.	
29762745	Genome-wide association analysis identifies a meningioma risk locus at 11p15.5.	Meningiomas are adult brain tumors originating in the meningeal coverings of the brain and spinal cord, with significant heritable basis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously identified only a single risk locus for meningioma, at 10p12.31. To identify a susceptibility locus for meningioma, we conducted a meta-analysis of 2 GWAS, imputed using a merged reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project and UK10K data, with validation in 2 independent sample series totaling 2138 cases and 12081 controls. We identified a new susceptibility locus for meningioma at 11p15.5 (rs2686876, odds ratio = 1.44, P = 9.86 × 10-9). A number of genes localize to the region of linkage disequilibrium encompassing rs2686876, including RIC8A, which plays a central role in the development of neural crest-derived structures, such as the meninges. This finding advances our understanding of the genetic basis of meningioma development and provides additional support for a polygenic model of meningioma.	
29760442	Cross-ancestry genome-wide association analysis of corneal thickness strengthens link between complex and Mendelian eye diseases.	Central corneal thickness (CCT) is a highly heritable trait associated with complex eye diseases such as keratoconus and glaucoma. We perform a genome-wide association meta-analysis of CCT and identify 19 novel regions. In addition to adding support for known connective tissue-related pathways, pathway analyses uncover previously unreported gene sets. Remarkably, >20% of the CCT-loci are near or within Mendelian disorder genes. These included FBN1, ADAMTS2 and TGFB2 which associate with connective tissue disorders (Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos and Loeys-Dietz syndromes), and the LUM-DCN-KERA gene complex involved in myopia, corneal dystrophies and cornea plana. Using index CCT-increasing variants, we find a significant inverse correlation in effect sizes between CCT and keratoconus (r = -0.62, P = 5.30 × 10(-5)) but not between CCT and primary open-angle glaucoma (r = -0.17, P = 0.2). Our findings provide evidence for shared genetic influences between CCT and keratoconus, and implicate candidate genes acting in collagen and extracellular matrix regulation.	
29767774	Common and Rare Variants Genetic Association Analysis of Cigarettes per Day Among Ever-Smokers in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Cases and Controls.	Cigarette smoking is a major environmental risk factor for many diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are shared genetic influences on cigarette smoking and COPD. Genetic risk factors for cigarette smoking in cohorts enriched for COPD are largely unknown. We performed genome-wide association analyses for average cigarettes per day (CPD) across the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) non-Hispanic white (NHW) (n = 6659) and African American (AA) (n = 3260), GenKOLS (the Genetics of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) (n = 1671), and ECLIPSE (the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints) (n = 1942) cohorts. In addition, we performed exome array association analyses across the COPDGene NHW and AA cohorts. We considered analyses across the entire cohort and stratified by COPD case-control status. We identified genome-wide significant associations for CPD on chromosome 15q25 across all cohorts (lowest p = 1.78 × 10-15), except in the COPDGene AA cohort alone. Previously reported associations on chromosome 19 had suggestive and directionally consistent associations (RAB4, p = 1.95 × 10-6; CYP2A7, p = 7.50 × 10-5; CYP2B6, p = 4.04 × 10-4). When we stratified by COPD case-control status, single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 15q25 were nominally associated with both NHW COPD cases (β = 0.11, p = 5.58 × 10-4) and controls (β = 0.12, p = 3.86 × 10-5) For the gene-based exome array association analysis of rare variants, there were no exome-wide significant associations. For these previously replicated associations, the most significant results were among COPDGene NHW subjects for CYP2A7 (p = 5.2 × 10-4). In a large genome-wide association study of both common variants and a gene-based association of rare coding variants in ever-smokers, we found genome-wide significant associations on chromosome 15q25 with CPD for common variants, but not for rare coding variants. These results were directionally consistent among COPD cases and controls. We examined both common and rare coding variants associated with CPD in a large population of heavy smokers with and without COPD of NHW and AA descent. We replicated genome-wide significant associations on chromosome 15q25 with CPD for common variants among NHW subjects, but not for rare variants. We demonstrated for the first time that common variants on chromosome 15q25 associated with CPD are similar among COPD cases and controls. Previously reported associations on chromosome 19 showed suggestive and directionally consistent associations among common variants (RAB4, CYP2A7, and CYP2B6) and for rare variants (CYP2A7) among COPDGene NHW subjects. Although the genetic effect sizes for these single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 15q25 are modest, we show that this creates a substantial smoking burden over the lifetime of a smoker.	
29769521	Thirty loci identified for heart rate response to exercise and recovery implicate autonomic nervous system.	Impaired capacity to increase heart rate (HR) during exercise (ΔHR(ex)), and a reduced rate of recovery post-exercise (ΔHR(rec)) are associated with higher cardiovascular mortality rates. Currently, the genetic basis of both phenotypes remains to be elucidated. We conduct genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for ΔHR(ex) and ΔHR(rec) in ~40,000 individuals, followed by replication in ~27,000 independent samples, all from UK Biobank. Six and seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms for ΔHR(ex) and ΔHR(rec), respectively, formally replicate. In a full data set GWAS, eight further loci for ΔHR(ex) and nine for ΔHR(rec) are genome-wide significant (P ≤ 5 × 10(-8)). In total, 30 loci are discovered, 8 being common across traits. Processes of neural development and modulation of adrenergic activity by the autonomic nervous system are enriched in these results. Our findings reinforce current understanding of HR response to exercise and recovery and could guide future studies evaluating its contribution to cardiovascular risk prediction.	
29771307	Assessment of rosacea symptom severity by genome-wide association study and expression analysis highlights immuno-inflammatory and skin pigmentation genes.	Rosacea is a common, chronic skin disease of variable severity with limited treatment options. The cause of rosacea is unknown, but it is believed to be due to a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. Little is known about the genetics of the disease. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of rosacea symptom severity with data from 73 265 research participants of European ancestry from the 23andMe customer base. Seven loci had variants associated with rosacea at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10-8). Further analyses highlighted likely gene regions or effector genes including IRF4 (P = 1.5 × 10-17), a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region flanked by PSMB9 and HLA-DMB (P = 2.2 × 10-15), HERC2-OCA2 (P = 4.2 × 10-12), SLC45A2 (P = 1.7 × 10-10), IL13 (P = 2.8 × 10-9), a region flanked by NRXN3 and DIO2 (P = 4.1 × 10-9), and a region flanked by OVOL1and SNX32 (P = 1.2 × 10-8). All associations with rosacea were novel except for the HLA locus. Two of these loci (HERC-OCA2 and SLC45A2) and another precedented variant (rs1805007 in melanocortin 1 receptor) with an association P value just below the significance threshold (P = 1.3 × 10-7) have been previously associated with skin phenotypes and pigmentation, two of these loci are linked to immuno-inflammation phenotypes (IL13 and PSMB9-HLA-DMA) and one has been associated with both categories (IRF4). Genes within three loci (PSMB9-HLA-DMA, HERC-OCA2 and NRX3-DIO2) were differentially expressed in a previously published clinical rosacea transcriptomics study that compared lesional to non-lesional samples. The identified loci provide specificity of inflammatory mechanisms in rosacea, and identify potential pathways for therapeutic intervention.	
29769613	Genetic variant for behavioral regulation factor of executive function and its possible brain mechanism in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.	As a childhood-onset psychiatric disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is complicated by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Lifelong executive function deficits in ADHD are described in many literatures and have been proposed as endophenotypes of ADHD. However, its genetic basis is still elusive. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study of executive function, rated with Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), in ADHD children. We identified one significant variant (rs852004, P = 2.51e-08) for the overall score of BRIEF. The association analyses for each component of executive function found this locus was more associated with inhibit and monitor components. Further principle component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis provided an ADHD-specific executive function pattern including inhibit and monitor factors. SNP rs852004 was mainly associated with the Behavioral Regulation factor. Meanwhile, we found the significant locus was associated with ADHD symptom. The Behavioral Regulation factor mediated its effect on ADHD symptom. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses further showed evidence that this variant affected the activity of inhibition control related brain regions. It provided new insights for the genetic basis of executive function in ADHD.	
29769526	A whole-genome sequence study identifies genetic risk factors for neuromyelitis optica.	Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the optic nerve and spinal cord. Most NMO patients ( > 70%) are seropositive for circulating autoantibodies against aquaporin 4 (NMO-IgG+). Here, we meta-analyze whole-genome sequences from 86 NMO cases and 460 controls with genome-wide SNP array from 129 NMO cases and 784 controls to test for association with SNPs and copy number variation (total N = 215 NMO cases, 1244 controls). We identify two independent signals in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region associated with NMO-IgG+, one of which may be explained by structural variation in the complement component 4 genes. Mendelian Randomization analysis reveals a significant causal effect of known systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but not multiple sclerosis (MS), risk variants in NMO-IgG+. Our results suggest that genetic variants in the MHC region contribute to the etiology of NMO-IgG+ and that NMO-IgG+ is genetically more similar to SLE than MS.	
29868124	Genetics of Obesity Traits: A Bivariate Genome-Wide Association Analysis.	Previous genome-wide association studies on anthropometric measurements have identified more than 100 related loci, but only a small portion of heritability in obesity was explained. Here we present a bivariate twin study to look for the genetic variants associated with body mass index and waist-hip ratio, and to explore the obesity-related pathways in Northern Han Chinese. Cholesky decomposition model for 242 monozygotic and 140 dizygotic twin pairs indicated a moderate genetic correlation ((r) = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.42-0.64) between body mass index and waist-hip ratio. Bivariate genome-wide association analysis in 139 dizygotic twin pairs identified 26 associated SNPs with(p) < 10(-5). Further gene-based analysis found 291 nominally associated genes ((P) < 0.05), including(F12, HCRTR1, PHOSPHO1, DOCK2, DOCK6, DGKB, GLP1R, TRHR, MMP1, GPR55, CCK), and(OR2AK2), as well as 6 enriched gene-sets with FDR < 0.05. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis identified rs2242044 as a significant cis-eQTL in both the normal adipose-subcutaneous ((P) = 1.7 × 10(-9)) and adipose-visceral ((P) = 4.4 × 10(-15)) tissue. These findings may provide an important entry point to unravel genetic pleiotropy in obesity traits.	
29773799	Elucidating the genetic architecture of reproductive ageing in the Japanese population.	Population studies elucidating the genetic architecture of reproductive ageing have been largely limited to European ancestries, restricting the generalizability of the findings and overlooking possible key genes poorly captured by common European genetic variation. Here, we report 26 loci (all P < 5 × 10(-8)) for reproductive ageing, i.e. puberty timing or age at menopause, in a non-European population (up to 67,029 women of Japanese ancestry). Highlighted genes for menopause include GNRH1, which supports a primary, rather than passive, role for hypothalamic-pituitary GnRH signalling in the timing of menopause. For puberty timing, we demonstrate an aetiological role for receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases by combining evidence across population genetics and pre- and peri-pubertal changes in hypothalamic gene expression in rodent and primate models. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate widespread differences in allele frequencies and effect estimates between Japanese and European associated variants, highlighting the benefits and challenges of large-scale trans-ethnic approaches.	
30271932	A truncating mutation in EPOR leads to hypo-responsiveness to erythropoietin with normal haemoglobin.	The cytokine erythropoietin (EPO), signalling through the EPO receptor (EPO-R), is essential for the formation of red blood cells. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) testing 32.5 million sequence variants for association with serum EPO levels in a set of 4187 individuals. We detect an association between a rare and well imputed stop-gained variant rs370865377[A] (p.Gln82Ter) in(EPOR), carried by 1 in 550 Icelanders, and increased serum EPO levels (MAF = 0.09%, Effect = 1.47 SD,(P) = 3.3 × 10(-7)). We validated these findings by measuring serum EPO levels in 34 additional pairs of carriers and matched controls and found carriers to have 3.23-fold higher EPO levels than controls ((P) = 1.7 × 10(-6);(P)(combined) = 1.6 × 10(-11)). In contrast to previously reported EPOR mutations, p.Gln82Ter does not associate with haemoglobin levels (Effect = -0.045 SD,(P) = 0.32,(N) = 273,160), probably due to a compensatory EPO upregulation in response to EPO-R hypo-responsiveness.	
29777097	GWAS on family history of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a public health priority for the 21st century. Risk reduction currently revolves around lifestyle changes with much research trying to elucidate the biological underpinnings. We show that self-report of parental history of Alzheimer's dementia for case ascertainment in a genome-wide association study of 314,278 participants from UK Biobank (27,696 maternal cases, 14,338 paternal cases) is a valid proxy for an AD genetic study. After meta-analysing with published consortium data (n = 74,046 with 25,580 cases across the discovery and replication analyses), three new AD-associated loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)) are identified. These contain genes relevant for AD and neurodegeneration: ADAM10, BCKDK/KAT8 and ACE. Novel gene-based loci include drug targets such as VKORC1 (warfarin dose). We report evidence that the association of SNPs in the TOMM40 gene with AD is potentially mediated by both gene expression and DNA methylation in the prefrontal cortex. However, it is likely that multiple variants are affecting the trait and gene methylation/expression. Our discovered loci may help to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying AD and, as they contain genes that are drug targets for other diseases and disorders, warrant further exploration for potential precision medicine applications.	
29779033	Genome-Wide Association Study of Renal Function Traits: Results from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a rapidly growing, worldwide public health problem. Recent advances in genome-wide-association studies (GWAS) revealed several genetic loci associated with renal function traits worldwide. We investigated the association of genetic factors with the levels of serum creatinine (SCr) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in Japanese population-based cohorts analyzing the GWAS imputed data with 11,221 subjects and 12,617,569 variants, and replicated the findings with the 148,829 hospital-based Japanese subjects. In the discovery phase, 28 variants within 4 loci (chromosome [chr] 2 with 8 variants including rs3770636 in the LDL receptor related protein 2 gene locus, on chr 5 with 2 variants including rs270184, chr 17 with 15 variants including rs3785837 in the BCAS3 gene locus, and chr 18 with 3 variants including rs74183647 in the nuclear factor of -activated T-cells 1 gene locus) reached the suggestive level of p < 1 × 10-6 in association with eGFR and SCr, and 2 variants on chr 4 (including rs78351985 in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene locus) fulfilled the suggestive level in association with the risk of CKD. In the replication phase, 25 variants within 3 loci (chr 2 with 7 variants, chr 17 with 15 variants and chr 18 with 3 variants) in association with eGFR and SCr, and 2 variants on chr 4 associated with the risk of CKD became nominally statistically significant after Bonferroni correction, among which 15 variants on chr 17 and 3 variants on chr 18 reached genome-wide significance of p < 5 × 10-8 in the combined study meta-analysis. The associations of the loci on chr 2 and 18 with eGFR and SCr as well as that on chr 4 with CKD risk have not been previously reported in the Japanese and East Asian populations. Although the present GWAS of renal function traits included the largest sample of Japanese participants to date, we did not identify novel loci for renal traits. However, we identified the novel associations of the genetic loci on chr 2, 4, and 18 with renal function traits in the Japanese population, suggesting these are transethnic loci. Further investigations of these associations are expected to further validate our findings for the potential establishment of personalized prevention of renal disease in the Japanese and East Asian populations.	
29782485	Evaluation and application of summary statistic imputation to discover new height-associated loci.	As most of the heritability of complex traits is attributed to common and low frequency genetic variants, imputing them by combining genotyping chips and large sequenced reference panels is the most cost-effective approach to discover the genetic basis of these traits. Association summary statistics from genome-wide meta-analyses are available for hundreds of traits. Updating these to ever-increasing reference panels is very cumbersome as it requires reimputation of the genetic data, rerunning the association scan, and meta-analysing the results. A much more efficient method is to directly impute the summary statistics, termed as summary statistics imputation, which we improved to accommodate variable sample size across SNVs. Its performance relative to genotype imputation and practical utility has not yet been fully investigated. To this end, we compared the two approaches on real (genotyped and imputed) data from 120K samples from the UK Biobank and show that, genotype imputation boasts a 3- to 5-fold lower root-mean-square error, and better distinguishes true associations from null ones: We observed the largest differences in power for variants with low minor allele frequency and low imputation quality. For fixed false positive rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, using summary statistics imputation yielded a decrease in statistical power by 9, 43 and 35%, respectively. To test its capacity to discover novel associations, we applied summary statistics imputation to the GIANT height meta-analysis summary statistics covering HapMap variants, and identified 34 novel loci, 19 of which replicated using data in the UK Biobank. Additionally, we successfully replicated 55 out of the 111 variants published in an exome chip study. Our study demonstrates that summary statistics imputation is a very efficient and cost-effective way to identify and fine-map trait-associated loci. Moreover, the ability to impute summary statistics is important for follow-up analyses, such as Mendelian randomisation or LD-score regression.	
29787419	A locus at 7p14.3 predisposes to refractory celiac disease progression from celiac disease.	Approximately 5% of patients with celiac disease (CeD) do not respond to a gluten-free diet and progress to refractory celiac disease (RCD), a severe progression that is characterized by infiltration of intraepithelial T lymphocytes. Patients with RCD type II (RCDII) show clonal expansions of intraepithelial T lymphocytes that result in a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate through development of aggressive enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. It is not known whether genetic variations play a role in severe progression of CeD to RCDII. We performed the first genome-wide association study to identify the causal genes for RCDII and the molecular pathways perturbed in RCDII. The genome-wide association study was performed in 38 Dutch patients with RCDII, and the 15 independent top-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants (P<5×10) were replicated in 56 independent French and Dutch patients with RCDII. After replication, SNP rs2041570 on chromosome 7 was significantly associated with progression to RCDII (P=2.37×10, odds ratio=2.36) but not with CeD susceptibility. SNP rs2041570 risk allele A was associated with lower levels of FAM188B expression in blood and small intestinal biopsies. Stratification of RCDII biopsies based on rs2041570 genotype showed differential expression of innate immune and antibacterial genes that are expressed in Paneth cells. We have identified a novel SNP associated with the severe progression of CeD to RCDII. Our data suggest that genetic susceptibility to CeD might be distinct from the progression to RCDII and suggest a role for Paneth cells in RCDII progression.	
29784950	Genome-wide association study identified new susceptible genetic variants in HLA class I region for hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.	We have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 473 Japanese HBV (hepatitis B virus)-positive HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) patients and 516 HBV carriers including chronic hepatitis and asymptomatic carrier individuals to identify new host genetic factors associated with HBV-derived HCC in Japanese and other East Asian populations. We identified 65 SNPs with P values < 10(-4) located within the HLA class I region and three SNPs were genotyped in three independent population-based replication sets. Meta-analysis confirmed the association of the three SNPs (rs2523961: OR = 1.73, P = 7.50 × 10(-12); rs1110446: OR = 1.79, P = 1.66 × 10(-13); and rs3094137: OR = 1.73, P = 7.09 × 10(-9)). We then performed two-field HLA genotype imputation for six HLA loci using genotyping data to investigate the association between HLA alleles and HCC. HLA allele association testing revealed that HLA-A(*) 33:03 (OR = 1.97, P = 4.58 × 10(-4)) was significantly associated with disease progression to HCC. Conditioning analysis of each of the three SNPs on the HLA class I region abolished the association of HLA-A(*)33:03 with disease progression to HCC. However, conditioning the HLA allele could not eliminate the association of the three SNPs, suggesting that additional genetic factors may exist in the HLA class I region.	
29785011	A genome-wide cross-trait analysis from UK Biobank highlights the shared genetic architecture of asthma and allergic diseases.	Clinical and epidemiological data suggest that asthma and allergic diseases are associated and may share a common genetic etiology. We analyzed genome-wide SNP data for asthma and allergic diseases in 33,593 cases and 76,768 controls of European ancestry from UK Biobank. Two publicly available independent genome-wide association studies were used for replication. We have found a strong genome-wide genetic correlation between asthma and allergic diseases (r(g) = 0.75, P = 6.84 × 10(-62)). Cross-trait analysis identified 38 genome-wide significant loci, including 7 novel shared loci. Computational analysis showed that shared genetic loci are enriched in immune/inflammatory systems and tissues with epithelium cells. Our work identifies common genetic architectures shared between asthma and allergy and will help to advance understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying co-morbid asthma and allergic diseases.	
29781551	A univariate perspective of multivariate genome-wide association analysis.	Multiple correlated phenotypes are frequently collected in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), and a systematic, simultaneous analysis of multiple phenotypes can integrate the signals from single phenotypes, therefore increasing the power of detecting genetic signals. However, fundamental questions remain open, including the conditions and reasons under which the multivariate analysis is beneficial, how a highly significant signal arises in the multivariate analysis. To understand these issues, we propose to decompose the multivariate model into a series of simple univariate models. This transformation offers a clearer quantitative analysis of the circumstances under which a multivariate approach can be beneficial for the bivariate phenotypes case. A real data analysis is employed to illustrate how to interpret how the signals arising from multivariate GWASs.	
29785010	Genome-wide analyses identify 68 new loci associated with intraocular pressure and improve risk prediction for primary open-angle glaucoma.	Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally(1) . Despite its gravity, the disease is frequently undiagnosed in the community(2) . Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)(3,4). Here we present a meta-analysis of 139,555 European participants, which identified 112 genomic loci associated with IOP, 68 of which are novel. These loci suggest a strong role for angiopoietin-receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and developmental processes underlying risk for elevated IOP. In addition, 48 of these loci were nominally associated with glaucoma in an independent cohort, 14 of which were significant at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. Regression-based glaucoma-prediction models had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76 in US NEIGHBORHOOD study participants and 0.74 in independent glaucoma cases from the UK Biobank. Genetic-prediction models for POAG offer an opportunity to target screening and timely therapy to individuals most at risk.	
29786918	Novel genes and insights in complete asthma remission: A genome-wide association study on clinical and complete asthma remission.	Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease without a cure, although there exists spontaneous remission. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have pinpointed genes associated with asthma development, but did not investigate asthma remission. We performed a GWA study to develop insights in asthma remission. Clinical remission (ClinR) was defined by the absence of asthma treatment and wheezing in the last year and asthma attacks in the last 3 years and complete remission (ComR) similarly but additionally with normal lung function and absence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). A GWA study on both ClinR and ComR was performed in 790 asthmatics with initial doctor diagnosis of asthma and BHR and long-term follow-up. We assessed replication of the 25 top single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2 independent cohorts (total n = 456), followed by expression quantitative loci (eQTL) analyses of the 4 replicated SNPs in lung tissue and epithelium. Of the 790 asthmatics, 178 (23%) had ClinR and 55 ComR (7%) after median follow-up of 15.5 (range 3.3-47.8) years. In ClinR, 1 of the 25 SNPs, rs2740102, replicated in a meta-analysis of the replication cohorts, which was an eQTL for POLI in lung tissue. In ComR, 3 SNPs replicated in a meta-analysis of the replication cohorts. The top-hit, rs6581895, almost reached genome-wide significance (P-value 4.68 × 10(-7) ) and was an eQTL for FRS2 and CCT in lung tissue. Rs1420101 was a cis-eQTL in lung tissue for IL1RL1 and IL18R1 and a trans-eQTL for IL13. By defining a strict remission phenotype, we identified 3 SNPs to be associated with complete asthma remission, where 2 SNPs have plausible biological relevance in FRS2, CCT, IL1RL1, IL18R1 and IL13.	
29808027	Genome-wide association meta-analysis highlights light-induced signaling as a driver for refractive error.	Refractive errors, including myopia, are the most frequent eye disorders worldwide and an increasingly common cause of blindness. This genome-wide association meta-analysis in 160,420 participants and replication in 95,505 participants increased the number of established independent signals from 37 to 161 and showed high genetic correlation between Europeans and Asians (>0.78). Expression experiments and comprehensive in silico analyses identified retinal cell physiology and light processing as prominent mechanisms, and also identified functional contributions to refractive-error development in all cell types of the neurosensory retina, retinal pigment epithelium, vascular endothelium and extracellular matrix. Newly identified genes implicate novel mechanisms such as rod-and-cone bipolar synaptic neurotransmission, anterior-segment morphology and angiogenesis. Thirty-one loci resided in or near regions transcribing small RNAs, thus suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation. Our results support the notion that refractive errors are caused by a light-dependent retina-to-sclera signaling cascade and delineate potential pathobiological molecular drivers.	
29844224	Genome-Wide Association Study of Serum Fructosamine and Glycated Albumin in Adults Without Diagnosed Diabetes: Results From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.	Fructosamine and glycated albumin are potentially useful alternatives to hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) as diabetes biomarkers. The genetic determinants of fructosamine and glycated albumin, however, are unknown. We performed genome-wide association studies of fructosamine and glycated albumin among 2,104 black and 7,647 white participants without diabetes in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and replicated findings in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Among whites, rs34459162, a novel missense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in(RCN3), was associated with fructosamine ((P) = 5.3 × 10(-9)) and rs1260236, a known diabetes-related missense mutation in(GCKR), was associated with percent glycated albumin ((P) = 5.9 × 10(-9)) and replicated in CARDIA. We also found two novel associations among blacks: an intergenic SNP, rs2438321, associated with fructosamine ((P) = 6.2 × 10(-9)), and an intronic variant in(PRKCA), rs59443763, associated with percent glycated albumin ((P) = 4.1 × 10(-9)), but these results did not replicate. Few established fasting glucose or HbA(1c) SNPs were also associated with fructosamine or glycated albumin. Overall, we found genetic variants associated with the glycemic information captured by fructosamine and glycated albumin as well as with their nonglycemic component. This highlights the importance of examining the genetics of hyperglycemia biomarkers to understand the information they capture, including potential glucose-independent factors.	
29844566	Study of 300,486 individuals identifies 148 independent genetic loci influencing general cognitive function.	General cognitive function is a prominent and relatively stable human trait that is associated with many important life outcomes. We combine cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N = 300,486; age 16-102) and find 148 genome-wide significant independent loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)) associated with general cognitive function. Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity. In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function.	
29857070	Association Study and Fine-Mapping Major Histocompatibility Complex Analysis of Pemphigus Vulgaris in a Han Chinese Population.	To identify possible additional genetic susceptibility loci for pemphigus vulgaris (PV), we performed a genome-wide association study of 240 PV patients and 1,031 control individuals, and we selected the top single nucleotide polymorphisms for replication in independent samples, with 252 patient samples and 1,852 control samples. We identified rs11218708 (P = 3.1 × 10(-8), odds ratio = 1.54) at chromosome locus 11q24.1 as significantly associated with PV. A fine-mapping analysis of PV risk in the major histocompatibility complex region showed three independent variants predisposed to PV using stepwise analysis: HLA-DRB1*14:04 (P = 2.47 × 10(-38), odds ratio = 6.28), rs7454108 at the TAP2 gene (P = 2.78 × 10(-12), odds ratio = 3.25), and rs1051336 at the HLA-DRA gene (P = 3.06 × 10(-6), odds ratio = 0.33). A systematic evaluation using gene- and pathway-based analyses showed a high tendency for PV susceptibility genes to be associated with autoimmunity. Our study highlights the involvement of immune-mediated processes in the pathophysiology of PV and illustrates the value of imputation to identify variants in the major histocompatibility complex region.	
30680360	Genomewide Association Study of Fracture Nonunion Using Electronic Health Records.	Nonunion is a clinically significant complication of fracture associated with worse outcomes, including increased pain, disability, and higher healthcare costs. The risk for nonunion is likely to be complex and multifactorial, and as such, the biology underlying such risk remains poorly understood. Genetic studies represent one approach to identify implicated biology for further investigation, but to date the lack of large cohorts for study has limited such efforts. We utilized the electronic health records of two large academic medical centers in Boston to identify individuals with fracture nonunion and control individuals with fracture but no evidence of nonunion. We conducted a genomewide association study among 1760 individuals of Northern European ancestry with upper or lower extremity fracture, including 131 with nonunion, to examine whether common variants were associated with nonunion in this cohort. In all, one locus in the Calcyon (CALY) gene exceeded a genomewide threshold for statistical significance ((p) = 1.95e-8), with eight additional loci associated with(p )< 5e-7. Previously reported candidate genes were not supported by this analysis. Electronic health records should facilitate identification of common genetic variations associated with adverse orthopedic outcomes. The loci we identified in this small cohort require replication and further study to characterize mechanism of action, but represent a starting point for the investigation of genetic liability for this costly outcome.	
29860282	Genetic study of multimodal imaging Alzheimer's disease progression score implicates novel loci.	Identifying genetic risk factors underpinning different aspects of Alzheimer's disease has the potential to provide important insights into pathogenesis. Moving away from simple case-control definitions, there is considerable interest in using quantitative endophenotypes, such as those derived from imaging as outcome measures. Previous genome-wide association studies of imaging-derived biomarkers in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease focused only on phenotypes derived from single imaging modalities. In contrast, we computed a novel multi-modal neuroimaging phenotype comprising cortical amyloid burden and bilateral hippocampal volume. Both imaging biomarkers were used as input to a disease progression modelling algorithm, which estimates the biomarkers' long-term evolution curves from population-based longitudinal data. Among other parameters, the algorithm computes the shift in time required to optimally align a subjects' biomarker trajectories with these population curves. This time shift serves as a disease progression score and it was used as a quantitative trait in a discovery genome-wide association study with n = 944 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment or healthy at the time of imaging. We identified a genome-wide significant locus implicating LCORL (rs6850306, chromosome 4; P = 1.03 × 10-8). The top variant rs6850306 was found to act as an expression quantitative trait locus for LCORL in brain tissue. The clinical role of rs6850306 in conversion from healthy ageing to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease was further validated in an independent cohort comprising healthy, older subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Specifically, possession of a minor allele at rs6850306 was protective against conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center cohort (hazard ratio = 0.593, 95% confidence interval = 0.387-0.907, n = 911, PBonf = 0.032), in keeping with the negative direction of effect reported in the genome-wide association study (βdisease progression score = -0.07 ± 0.01). The implicated locus is linked to genes with known connections to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and other neurodegenerative diseases. Using multimodal imaging phenotypes in association studies may assist in unveiling the genetic drivers of the onset and progression of complex diseases.	
29848360	Genome-wide association study meta-analysis identifies five new loci for systemic lupus erythematosus.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common systemic autoimmune disease with a complex genetic inheritance. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have significantly increased the number of significant loci associated with SLE risk. To date, however, established loci account for less than 30% of the disease heritability and additional risk variants have yet to be identified. Here we performed a GWAS followed by a meta-analysis to identify new genome-wide significant loci for SLE. We genotyped a cohort of 907 patients with SLE (cases) and 1524 healthy controls from Spain and performed imputation using the 1000 Genomes reference data. We tested for association using logistic regression with correction for the principal components of variation. Meta-analysis of the association results was subsequently performed on 7,110,321 variants using genetic data from a large cohort of 4036 patients with SLE and 6959 controls of Northern European ancestry. Genetic association was also tested at the pathway level after removing the effect of known risk loci using PASCAL software. We identified five new loci associated with SLE at the genome-wide level of significance (p < 5 × 10(- 8)): GRB2, SMYD3, ST8SIA4, LAT2 and ARHGAP27. Pathway analysis revealed several biological processes significantly associated with SLE risk: B cell receptor signaling (p = 5.28 × 10(- 6)), CTLA4 co-stimulation during T cell activation (p = 3.06 × 10(- 5)), interleukin-4 signaling (p = 3.97 × 10(- 5)) and cell surface interactions at the vascular wall (p = 4.63 × 10(- 5)). Our results identify five novel loci for SLE susceptibility, and biologic pathways associated via multiple low-effect-size loci.	
29855537	Japanese GWAS identifies variants for bust-size, dysmenorrhea, and menstrual fever that are eQTLs for relevant protein-coding or long non-coding RNAs.	Traits related to primary and secondary sexual characteristics greatly impact females during puberty and day-to-day adult life. Therefore, we performed a GWAS analysis of 11,348 Japanese female volunteers and 22 gynecology-related phenotypic variables, and identified significant associations for bust-size, menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea) severity, and menstrual fever. Bust-size analysis identified significant association signals in CCDC170-ESR1 (rs6557160; P = 1.7 × 10(-16)) and KCNU1-ZNF703 (rs146992477; P = 6.2 × 10(-9)) and found that one-third of known European-ancestry associations were also present in Japanese. eQTL data points to CCDC170 and ZNF703 as those signals' functional targets. For menstrual fever, we identified a novel association in OPRM1 (rs17181171; P = 2.0 × 10(-8)), for which top variants were eQTLs in multiple tissues. A known dysmenorrhea signal near NGF replicated in our data (rs12030576; P = 1.1 × 10(-19)) and was associated with RP4-663N10.1 expression, a putative lncRNA enhancer of NGF, while a novel dysmenorrhea signal in the IL1 locus (rs80111889; P = 1.9 × 10(-16)) contained SNPs previously associated with endometriosis, and GWAS SNPs were most significantly associated with IL1A expression. By combining regional imputation with colocalization analysis of GWAS/eQTL signals along with integrated annotation with epigenomic data, this study further refines the sets of candidate causal variants and target genes for these known and novel gynecology-related trait loci.	
29855589	GWAS reveals loci associated with velopharyngeal dysfunction.	Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) occurs when the muscular soft palate (velum) and lateral pharyngeal walls are physically unable to separate the oral and nasal cavities during speech production leading to hypernasality and abnormal speech reduction. Because VPD is often associated with overt or submucous cleft palate, it could be present as a subclinical phenotype in families with a history of orofacial clefting. A key assumption to this model is that the overt and subclinical manifestations of the orofacial cleft phenotype exist on a continuum and therefore share common etiological factors. We performed a genome-wide association study in 976 unaffected relatives of isolated CP probands, 54 of whom had VPD. Five loci were significantly (p < 5 × 10(-8)) associated with VPD: 3q29, 9p21.1, 12q21.31, 16p12.3 and 16p13.3. An additional 15 loci showing suggestive evidence of association with VPD were observed. Several genes known to be involved in orofacial clefting and craniofacial development are located in these regions, such as TFRC, PCYT1A, BNC2 and FREM1. Although further research is necessary, this could be an indication for a potential shared genetic architecture between VPD and cleft palate, and supporting the hypothesis that VPD is a subclinical phenotype of orofacial clefting.	
30273415	Genome-wide association study of developmental dysplasia of the hip identifies an association with 	Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is the most common skeletal developmental disease. However, its genetic architecture is poorly understood. We conduct the largest DDH genome-wide association study to date and replicate our findings in independent cohorts. We find the heritable component of DDH attributable to common genetic variants to be 55% and distributed equally across the autosomal and X-chromosomes. We identify replicating evidence for association between(GDF5) promoter variation and DDH (rs143384, effect allele A, odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.34-1.56,(P) = 3.55 × 10(-22)). Gene-based analysis implicates(GDF5) ((P) = 9.24 × 10(-12)),(UQCC1) ((P) = 1.86 × 10(-)(10)),(MMP24) ((P) = 3.18 × 10(-9)),(RETSAT) ((P) = 3.70 × 10(-)(8)) and(PDRG1) ((P) = 1.06 × 10(-)(7)) in DDH susceptibility. We find shared genetic architecture between DDH and hip osteoarthritis, but no predictive power of osteoarthritis polygenic risk score on DDH status, underscoring the complex nature of the two traits. We report a scalable, time-efficient recruitment strategy and establish for the first time to our knowledge a robust DDH genetic association locus at(GDF5).	
29967566	Pathway-Wide Genetic Risks in Chlamydial Infections Overlap between Tissue Tropisms: A Genome-Wide Association Scan.	(Chlamydia trachomatis) is the most commonly diagnosed bacterial sexually transmitted infection and can lead to tubal factor infertility, a disease characterised by fibrosis of the fallopian tubes. Genetic polymorphisms in molecular pathways involving G protein-coupled receptor signalling, the Akt/PI3K cascade, the mitotic cell cycle, and immune response have been identified in association with the development of trachomatous scarring, an ocular form of chlamydia-related fibrotic pathology. In this case-control study, we performed genome-wide association and pathways-based analysis in a sample of 71 Dutch women who attended an STI clinic who were seropositive for(Chlamydia trachomatis) antibodies and 169 high-risk Dutch women who sought similar health services but who were seronegative. We identified two regions of within-gene SNP association with(Chlamydia trachomatis) serological response and found that GPCR signalling and cell cycle pathways were also associated with the trait. These pathway-level associations appear to be common to immunological sequelae of chlamydial infections in both ocular and urogenital tropisms. These pathways may be central mediators of human refractoriness to chlamydial diseases.	
29883787	Genome-wide association study of extreme high bone mass: Contribution of common genetic variation to extreme BMD phenotypes and potential novel BMD-associated genes.	Generalised high bone mass (HBM), associated with features of a mild skeletal dysplasia, has a prevalence of 0.18% in a UK DXA-scanned adult population. We hypothesized that the genetic component of extreme HBM includes contributions from common variants of small effect and rarer variants of large effect, both enriched in an extreme phenotype cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of adults with either extreme high or low BMD. Adults included individuals with unexplained extreme HBM (n = 240) from the UK with BMD Z-scores ≥+3.2, high BMD females from the Anglo-Australasian Osteoporosis Genetics Consortium (AOGC) (n = 1055) with Z-scores +1.5 to +4.0 and low BMD females also part of AOGC (n = 900), with Z-scores -1.5 to -4.0. Following imputation, we tested association between 6,379,332 SNPs and total hip and lumbar spine BMD Z-scores. For potential target genes, we assessed expression in human osteoblasts and murine osteocytes. We observed significant enrichment for associations with established BMD-associated loci, particularly those known to regulate endochondral ossification and Wnt signalling, suggesting that part of the genetic contribution to unexplained HBM is polygenic. Further, we identified associations exceeding genome-wide significance between BMD and four loci: two established BMD-associated loci (5q14.3 containing MEF2C and 1p36.12 containing WNT4) and two novel loci: 5p13.3 containing NPR3 (rs9292469; minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.33%) associated with lumbar spine BMD and 11p15.2 containing SPON1 (rs2697825; MAF = 0.17%) associated with total hip BMD. Mouse models with mutations in either Npr3 or Spon1 have been reported, both have altered skeletal phenotypes, providing in vivo validation that these genes are physiologically important in bone. NRP3 regulates endochondral ossification and skeletal growth, whilst SPON1 modulates TGF-β regulated BMP-driven osteoblast differentiation. Rs9292469 (downstream of NPR3) also showed some evidence for association with forearm BMD in the independent GEFOS sample (n = 32,965). We found Spon1 was highly expressed in murine osteocytes from the tibiae, femora, humeri and calvaria, whereas Npr3 expression was more variable. We report the most extreme-truncate GWAS of BMD performed to date. Our findings, suggest potentially new anabolic bone regulatory pathways that warrant further study.	
29885931	Genome-wide association studies suggest that APOL1-environment interactions more likely trigger kidney disease in African Americans with nondiabetic nephropathy than strong APOL1-second gene interactions.	African Americans carrying two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal risk variants have a high risk for nephropathy. However, only a minority develops end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hence, modifying factors likely contribute to initiation of kidney disease such as endogenous (HIV infection) or exogenous (interferon treatment) environmental modifiers. In this report, genome-wide association studies and a meta-analysis were performed to identify novel loci for nondiabetic ESRD in African Americans and to detect genetic modifiers in APOL1-associated nephropathy. Two African American cohorts were analyzed, 1749 nondiabetic ESRD cases and 1136 controls from Wake Forest and 901 lupus nephritis (LN)-ESRD cases and 520 controls with systemic lupus erythematosus but lacking nephropathy from the LN-ESRD Consortium. Association analyses adjusting for APOL1 G1/G2 renal-risk variants were completed and stratified by APOL1 risk genotype status. Individual genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis results of all 2650 ESRD cases and 1656 controls did not detect significant genome-wide associations with ESRD beyond APOL1. Similarly, no single nucleotide polymorphism showed significant genome-wide evidence of an interaction with APOL1 risk variants. Thus, although variants with small individual effects cannot be ruled out and are likely to exist, our results suggest that APOL1-environment interactions may be of greater clinical importance in triggering nephropathy in African Americans than APOL1 interactions with other single nucleotide polymorphisms.	
29875488	Genomic atlas of the human plasma proteome.	Although plasma proteins have important roles in biological processes and are the direct targets of many drugs, the genetic factors that control inter-individual variation in plasma protein levels are not well understood. Here we characterize the genetic architecture of the human plasma proteome in healthy blood donors from the INTERVAL study. We identify 1,927 genetic associations with 1,478 proteins, a fourfold increase on existing knowledge, including trans associations for 1,104 proteins. To understand the consequences of perturbations in plasma protein levels, we apply an integrated approach that links genetic variation with biological pathway, disease, and drug databases. We show that protein quantitative trait loci overlap with gene expression quantitative trait loci, as well as with disease-associated loci, and find evidence that protein biomarkers have causal roles in disease using Mendelian randomization analysis. By linking genetic factors to diseases via specific proteins, our analyses highlight potential therapeutic targets, opportunities for matching existing drugs with new disease indications, and potential safety concerns for drugs under development.	
29884837	Genome-wide association study identifies genes associated with neuropathy in patients with head and neck cancer.	Neuropathic pain (NP), defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system, is a debilitating chronic pain condition often resulting from cancer treatment. Among cancer patients, neuropathy during cancer treatment is a predisposing event for NP. To identify genetic variants influencing the development of NP, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 1,043 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, based on 714,494 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (130 cases, 913 controls). About 12.5% of the patients, who previously had cancer treatment, had neuropathy-associated diagnoses, as defined using the ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. We identified four common SNPs representing four genomic regions: 7q22.3 (rs10950641; SNX8; P = 3.39 × 10(-14)), 19p13.2 (rs4804217; PCP2; P = 2.95 × 10(-9)), 3q27.3 (rs6796803; KNG1; P = 6.42 × 10(-9)) and 15q22.2 (rs4775319; RORA; P = 1.02 × 10(-8)), suggesting SNX8, PCP2, KNG1 and RORA might be novel target genes for NP in patients with head and neck cancer. Future experimental validation to explore physiological effects of the identified SNPs will provide a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying NP and may provide insights into novel therapeutic targets for treatment and management of NP.	
29892016	Association analyses of more than 140,000 men identify 63 new prostate cancer susceptibility loci.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and fine-mapping efforts to date have identified more than 100 prostate cancer (PrCa)-susceptibility loci. We meta-analyzed genotype data from a custom high-density array of 46,939 PrCa cases and 27,910 controls of European ancestry with previously genotyped data of 32,255 PrCa cases and 33,202 controls of European ancestry. Our analysis identified 62 novel loci associated (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) with PrCa and one locus significantly associated with early-onset PrCa (≤55 years). Our findings include missense variants rs1800057 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16; P = 8.2 × 10(-9); G>C, p.Pro1054Arg) in ATM and rs2066827 (OR = 1.06; P = 2.3 × 10(-9); T>G, p.Val109Gly) in CDKN1B. The combination of all loci captured 28.4% of the PrCa familial relative risk, and a polygenic risk score conferred an elevated PrCa risk for men in the ninetieth to ninety-ninth percentiles (relative risk = 2.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.55-2.82) and first percentile (relative risk = 5.71; 95% CI: 5.04-6.48) risk stratum compared with the population average. These findings improve risk prediction, enhance fine-mapping, and provide insight into the underlying biology of PrCa(1).	
29891935	A multiethnic genome-wide association study of primary open-angle glaucoma identifies novel risk loci.	Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss, yet much of the genetic risk remains unaccounted for, especially in African-Americans who have a higher risk for developing POAG. We conduct a multiethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) of POAG in the GERA cohort, with replication in the UK Biobank (UKB), and vice versa, GWAS in UKB with replication in GERA. We identify 24 loci (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)), including 14 novel, of which 9 replicate (near FMNL2, PDE7B, TMTC2, IKZF2, CADM2, DGKG, ANKH, EXOC2, and LMX1B). Functional studies support intraocular pressure-related influences of FMNL2 and LMX1B, with certain Lmx1b mutations causing high IOP and glaucoma resembling POAG in mice. The newly identified loci increase the proportion of variance explained in each GERA race/ethnicity group, with the largest gain in African-Americans (0.5-3.1%). A meta-analysis combining GERA and UKB identifies 24 additional loci. Our study provides important insights into glaucoma pathogenesis.	
29892015	Multi-ethnic genome-wide association study for atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects more than 33 million individuals worldwide(1) and has a complex heritability(2). We conducted the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for AF to date, consisting of more than half a million individuals, including 65,446 with AF. In total, we identified 97 loci significantly associated with AF, including 67 that were novel in a combined-ancestry analysis, and 3 that were novel in a European-specific analysis. We sought to identify AF-associated genes at the GWAS loci by performing RNA-sequencing and expression quantitative trait locus analyses in 101 left atrial samples, the most relevant tissue for AF. We also performed transcriptome-wide analyses that identified 57 AF-associated genes, 42 of which overlap with GWAS loci. The identified loci implicate genes enriched within cardiac developmental, electrophysiological, contractile and structural pathways. These results extend our understanding of the biological pathways underlying AF and may facilitate the development of therapeutics for AF.	
30134812	Enrichment of B cell receptor signaling and epidermal growth factor receptor pathways in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a genome-wide genetic interaction study.	Recent identification of 10 germline variants predisposing to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) explicates genetic dependency of this asymptomatic precursor condition with multiple myeloma (MM). Yet much of genetic burden as well as functional links remain unexplained. We propose a workflow to expand the search for susceptibility loci with genome-wide interaction and for subsequent identification of genetic clusters and pathways. Polygenic interaction analysis on 243 cases/1285 controls identified 14 paired risk loci belonging to unique chromosomal bands which were then replicated in two independent sets (case only study, 82 individuals; case/control study 236 cases/ 2484 controls). Further investigation on gene-set enrichment, regulatory pathway and genetic network was carried out with stand-alone in silico tools separately for both interaction and genome-wide association study-detected risk loci. Intronic-PREX1 (20q13.13), a reported locus predisposing to MM was confirmed to have contribution to excess MGUS risk in interaction with SETBP1, a well-established candidate predisposing to myeloid malignancies. Pathway enrichment showed B cell receptor signaling pathway (P < 5.3 × 10(- 3)) downstream to allograft rejection pathway (P < 5.6 × 10(- 4)) and autoimmune thyroid disease pathway (P < 9.3 × 10(- 4)) as well as epidermal growth factor receptor regulation pathway (P < 2.4 × 10(- 2)) to be differentially regulated. Oncogene ALK and CDH2 were also identified to be moderately interacting with rs10251201 and rs16966921, two previously reported risk loci for MGUS. We described novel pathways and variants potentially causal for MGUS. The methodology thus proposed to facilitate our search streamlines risk locus-based interaction, genetic network and pathway enrichment analyses.	
29895819	Genome-wide association study in Japanese females identifies fifteen novel skin-related trait associations.	Skin trait variation impacts quality-of-life, especially for females from the viewpoint of beauty. To investigate genetic variation related to these traits, we conducted a GWAS of various skin phenotypes in 11,311 Japanese women and identified associations for age-spots, freckles, double eyelids, straight/curly hair, eyebrow thickness, hairiness, and sweating. In silico annotation with RoadMap Epigenomics epigenetic state maps and colocalization analysis of GWAS and GTEx Project eQTL signals provided information about tissue specificity, candidate causal variants, and functional target genes. Novel signals for skin-spot traits neighboured AKAP1/MSI2 (rs17833789; P = 2.2 × 10(-9)), BNC2 (rs10810635; P = 2.1 × 10(-22)), HSPA12A (rs12259842; P = 7.1 × 10(-11)), PPARGC1B (rs251468; P = 1.3 × 10(-21)), and RAB11FIP2 (rs10444039; P = 5.6 × 10(-21)). HSPA12A SNPs were the only protein-coding gene eQTLs identified across skin-spot loci. Double edged eyelid analysis identified that a signal around EMX2 (rs12570134; P = 8.2 × 10(-15)) was also associated with expression of EMX2 and the antisense-RNA gene EMX2OS in brain putamen basal ganglia tissue. A known hair morphology signal in EDAR was associated with both eyebrow thickness (rs3827760; P = 1.7 × 10(-9)) and straight/curly hair (rs260643; P = 1.6 × 10(-103)). Excessive hairiness signals' top SNPs were also eQTLs for TBX15 (rs984225; P = 1.6 × 10(-8)), BCL2 (rs7226979; P = 7.3 × 10(-11)), and GCC2 and LIMS1 (rs6542772; P = 2.2 × 10(-9)). For excessive sweating, top variants in two signals in chr2:28.82-29.05 Mb (rs56089836; P = 1.7 × 10(-11)) were eQTLs for either PPP1CB or PLB1, while a top chr16:48.26-48.45 Mb locus SNP was a known ABCC11 missense variant (rs6500380; P = 6.8 × 10(-10)). In total, we identified twelve loci containing sixteen association signals, of which fifteen were novel. These findings will help dermatologic researchers better understand the genetic underpinnings of skin-related phenotypic variation in human populations.	
29907492	Polygenic risk score, genome-wide association, and gene set analyses of cognitive domain deficits in schizophrenia.	This study assessed genetic contributions to six cognitive domains, identified by the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery as relevant for schizophrenia, cognition-enhancing, clinical trials. Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Schizophrenia polygenic risk scores showed significant negative correlations with each cognitive domain. Genome-wide association analyses identified loci associated with attention/vigilance (rs830786 within HNF4G), verbal memory (rs67017972 near NDUFS4), and reasoning/problem solving (rs76872642 within HDAC9). Gene set analysis identified unique and shared genes across cognitive domains. These findings suggest involvement of common and unique mechanisms across cognitive domains and may contribute to the discovery of new therapeutic targets to treat cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.	
29942513	Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms with mucinous colorectal cancer: genome-wide common variant and gene-based rare variant analyses.	Colorectal cancer has significant impact on individuals and healthcare systems. Many genes have been identified to influence its pathogenesis. However, the genetic basis of mucinous tumor histology, an aggressive subtype of colorectal cancer, is currently not well-known. This study aimed to identify common and rare genetic variations that are associated with the mucinous tumor phenotype. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data was investigated in a colorectal cancer patient cohort ((n) = 505). Association analyses were performed for 729,373 common SNPs and 275,645 rare SNPs. Common SNP association analysis was performed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression under different genetic models. Rare-variant association analysis was performed using a multi-marker test. No associations reached the traditional genome-wide significance. However, promising genetic associations were identified. The identified common SNPs significantly improved the discriminatory accuracy of the model for mucinous tumor phenotype. Specifically, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.703 (95% CI: 0.634-0.773) to 0.916 (95% CI: 0.873-0.960) when considering the most significant SNPs. Additionally, the rare variant analysis identified a number of genetic regions that potentially contain causal rare variants associated with the mucinous tumor phenotype. This is the first study applying both common and rare variant analyses to identify genetic associations with mucinous tumor phenotype using a genome-wide genotype data. Our results suggested novel associations with mucinous tumors. Once confirmed, these results will not only help us understand the biological basis of mucinous histology, but may also help develop targeted treatment options for mucinous tumors.	
29899525	Genome-wide association study of habitual physical activity in over 377,000 UK Biobank participants identifies multiple variants including CADM2 and APOE.	Physical activity (PA) protects against a wide range of diseases. Habitual PA appears to be heritable, motivating the search for specific genetic variants that may inform efforts to promote PA and target the best type of PA for each individual. We used data from the UK Biobank to perform the largest genome-wide association study of PA to date, using three measures based on self-report (n(max) = 377,234) and two measures based on wrist-worn accelerometry data (n(max) = 91,084). We examined genetic correlations of PA with other traits and diseases, as well as tissue-specific gene expression patterns. With data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC; n = 8,556) study, we performed a meta-analysis of our top hits for moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). We identified ten loci across all PA measures that were significant in both a basic and a fully adjusted model (p < 5 × 10(-9)). Upon meta-analysis of the nine top hits for MVPA with results from ARIC, eight were genome-wide significant. Interestingly, among these, the rs429358 variant in the APOE gene was the most strongly associated with MVPA, whereby the allele associated with higher Alzheimer's risk was associated with greater MVPA. However, we were not able to rule out possible selection bias underlying this result. Variants in CADM2, a gene previously implicated in obesity, risk-taking behavior and other traits, were found to be associated with habitual PA. We also identified three loci consistently associated (p < 5 × 10(-5)) with PA across both self-report and accelerometry, including CADM2. We found genetic correlations of PA with educational attainment, chronotype, psychiatric traits, and obesity-related traits. Tissue enrichment analyses implicate the brain and pituitary gland as locations where PA-associated loci may exert their actions. These results provide new insight into the genetic basis of habitual PA, and the genetic links connecting PA with other traits and diseases.	
29898447	Genome-Wide Association Study of Erosive Tooth Wear in a Finnish Cohort.	Erosive tooth wear is defined as irreversible loss of dental tissues due to intrinsic or extrinsic acids, exacerbated by mechanical forces. Recent studies have suggested a higher prevalence of erosive tooth wear in males, as well as a genetic contribution to susceptibility to erosive tooth wear. Our aim was to examine erosive tooth wear by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a sample of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (n = 1,962). Erosive tooth wear was assessed clinically using the basic erosive wear examination. A GWAS was performed for the whole sample as well as separately for males and females. We identified one genome-wide significant signal (rs11681214) in the GWAS of the whole sample near the genes PXDN and MYT1L. When the sample was stratified by sex, the strongest genome-wide significant signals were observed in or near the genes FGFR1, C8orf86, CDH4, SCD5, F2R, and ING1. Additionally, multiple suggestive association signals were detected in all GWASs performed. Many of the signals were in or near the genes putatively related to oral environment or tooth development, and some were near the regions considered to be associated with dental caries, such as 2p24, 4q21, and 13q33. Replications of these associations in other samples, as well as experimental studies to determine the biological functions of associated genetic variants, are needed.	
29903748	Transethnic, Genome-Wide Analysis Reveals Immune-Related Risk Alleles and Phenotypic Correlates in Pediatric Steroid-Sensitive Nephrotic Syndrome.	(Background) Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) is a childhood disease with unclear pathophysiology and genetic architecture. We investigated the genomic basis of SSNS in children recruited in Europe and the biopsy-based North American NEPTUNE cohort.(Methods) We performed three ancestry-matched, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 273 children with NS (Children Cohort Nephrosis and Virus [NEPHROVIR] cohort: 132 European, 56 African, and 85 Maghrebian) followed by independent replication in 112 European children, transethnic meta-analysis, and conditional analysis. GWAS alleles were used to perform glomerular(cis)-expression quantitative trait loci studies in 39 children in the NEPTUNE cohort and epidemiologic studies in GWAS and NEPTUNE (97 children) cohorts.(Results) Transethnic meta-analysis identified one SSNS-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1063348 in the 3' untranslated region of(HLA-DQB1) ((P)=9.3×10(-23)). Conditional analysis identified two additional independent risk alleles upstream of(HLA-DRB1) (rs28366266,(P)=3.7×10(-11)) and in the 3' untranslated region of(BTNL2) (rs9348883,(P)=9.4×10(-7)) within introns of(HCG23) and(LOC101929163) These three risk alleles were independent of the risk haplotype(DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02) identified in European patients. Increased burden of risk alleles across independent loci was associated with higher odds of SSNS. Increased burden of risk alleles across independent loci was associated with higher odds of SSNS, with younger age of onset across all cohorts, and with increased odds of complete remission across histologies in NEPTUNE children. rs1063348 associated with decreased glomerular expression of HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5, and HLA-DQB1.(Conclusions) Transethnic GWAS empowered discovery of three independent risk SNPs for pediatric SSNS. Characterization of these SNPs provide an entry for understanding immune dysregulation in NS and introducing a genomically defined classification.	
29917119	Novel Common Genetic Susceptibility Loci for Colorectal Cancer.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 42 loci (P < 5 × 10-8) associated with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Expanded consortium efforts facilitating the discovery of additional susceptibility loci may capture unexplained familial risk. We conducted a GWAS in European descent CRC cases and control subjects using a discovery-replication design, followed by examination of novel findings in a multiethnic sample (cumulative n = 163 315). In the discovery stage (36 948 case subjects/30 864 control subjects), we identified genetic variants with a minor allele frequency of 1% or greater associated with risk of CRC using logistic regression followed by a fixed-effects inverse variance weighted meta-analysis. All novel independent variants reaching genome-wide statistical significance (two-sided P < 5 × 10-8) were tested for replication in separate European ancestry samples (12 952 case subjects/48 383 control subjects). Next, we examined the generalizability of discovered variants in East Asians, African Americans, and Hispanics (12 085 case subjects/22 083 control subjects). Finally, we examined the contributions of novel risk variants to familial relative risk and examined the prediction capabilities of a polygenic risk score. All statistical tests were two-sided. The discovery GWAS identified 11 variants associated with CRC at P < 5 × 10-8, of which nine (at 4q22.2/5p15.33/5p13.1/6p21.31/6p12.1/10q11.23/12q24.21/16q24.1/20q13.13) independently replicated at a P value of less than .05. Multiethnic follow-up supported the generalizability of discovery findings. These results demonstrated a 14.7% increase in familial relative risk explained by common risk alleles from 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.9% to 13.7%; known variants) to 11.9% (95% CI = 9.2% to 15.5%; known and novel variants). A polygenic risk score identified 4.3% of the population at an odds ratio for developing CRC of at least 2.0. This study provides insight into the architecture of common genetic variation contributing to CRC etiology and improves risk prediction for individualized screening.	
29912962	Novel genetic associations for blood pressure identified via gene-alcohol interaction in up to 570K individuals across multiple ancestries.	Heavy alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for hypertension; the mechanism by which alcohol consumption impact blood pressure (BP) regulation remains unknown. We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study accounting for gene-alcohol consumption interaction for BP might identify additional BP loci and contribute to the understanding of alcohol-related BP regulation. We conducted a large two-stage investigation incorporating joint testing of main genetic effects and single nucleotide variant (SNV)-alcohol consumption interactions. In Stage 1, genome-wide discovery meta-analyses in ≈131K individuals across several ancestry groups yielded 3,514 SNVs (245 loci) with suggestive evidence of association (P < 1.0 x 10-5). In Stage 2, these SNVs were tested for independent external replication in ≈440K individuals across multiple ancestries. We identified and replicated (at Bonferroni correction threshold) five novel BP loci (380 SNVs in 21 genes) and 49 previously reported BP loci (2,159 SNVs in 109 genes) in European ancestry, and in multi-ancestry meta-analyses (P < 5.0 x 10-8). For African ancestry samples, we detected 18 potentially novel BP loci (P < 5.0 x 10-8) in Stage 1 that warrant further replication. Additionally, correlated meta-analysis identified eight novel BP loci (11 genes). Several genes in these loci (e.g., PINX1, GATA4, BLK, FTO and GABBR2) have been previously reported to be associated with alcohol consumption. These findings provide insights into the role of alcohol consumption in the genetic architecture of hypertension.	
29924316	Genome-wide association study of familial lung cancer.	To identify genetic variation associated with lung cancer risk, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of 685 lung cancer cases that had a family history of two or more first or second degree relatives compared with 744 controls without lung cancer that were genotyped on an Illumina Human OmniExpressExome-8v1 array. To ensure robust results, we further evaluated these findings using data from six additional studies that were assembled through the Transdisciplinary Research on Cancer of the Lung Consortium comprising 1993 familial cases and 33 690 controls. We performed a meta-analysis after imputation of all variants using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 (version 3 release date September 2013). Analyses were conducted for 9 327 222 SNPs integrating data from the two sources. A novel variant on chromosome 4p15.31 near the LCORL gene and an imputed rare variant intergenic between CDKN2A and IFNA8 on chromosome 9p21.3 were identified at a genome-wide level of significance for squamous cell carcinomas. Additionally, associations of CHRNA3 and CHRNA5 on chromosome 15q25.1 in sporadic lung cancer were confirmed at a genome-wide level of significance in familial lung cancer. Previously identified variants in or near CHRNA2, BRCA2, CYP2A6 for overall lung cancer, TERT, SECISPB2L and RTEL1 for adenocarcinoma and RAD52 and MHC for squamous carcinoma were significantly associated with lung cancer.	
29921221	Identification of five novel genetic loci related to facial morphology by genome-wide association studies.	Face morphology is strongly determined by genetic factors. However, only a small number of genes related to face morphology have been identified to date. Here, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 85 face morphological traits in 7569 Koreans (5643 in the discovery set and 1926 in the replication set). In this study, we analyzed 85 facial traits, including facial angles. After discovery GWAS, 128 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing an association of P < 5 × 10(- 6) were selected to determine the replication of the associations, and meta-analysis of discovery GWAS and the replication analysis resulted in five genome-wide significant loci. The OSR1-WDR35 [rs7567283, G allele, beta (se) = -0.536 (0.096), P = 2.75 × 10(- 8)] locus was associated with the facial frontal contour; the HOXD1-MTX2 [rs970797, A allele, beta (se) = 0.015 (0.003), P = 3.97 × 10(- 9)] and WDR27 [rs3736712, C allele, beta (se) = 0.293 (0.048), P = 8.44 × 10(- 10)] loci were associated with eye shape; and the SOX9 [rs2193054, C allele, beta (se) (ln-transformed) = -0.007 (0.001), P = 6.17 × 10(- 17)] and DHX35 [rs2206437, A allele, beta (se) = -0.283 (0.047), P = 1.61 × 10(- 9)] loci were associated with nose shape. WDR35 and SOX9 were related to known craniofacial malformations, i.e., cranioectodermal dysplasia 2 and campomelic dysplasia, respectively. In addition, we found three independent association signals in the SOX9 locus, and six known loci for nose size and shape were replicated in this study population. Interestingly, four SNPs within these five face morphology-related loci showed discrepancies in allele frequencies among ethnic groups. We identified five novel face morphology loci that were associated with facial frontal contour, nose shape, and eye shape. Our findings provide useful genetic information for the determination of face morphology.	
29923122	NUDT15 codon 139 is the best pharmacogenetic marker for predicting thiopurine-induced severe adverse events in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter study.	Despite NUDT15 variants showing significant association with thiopurine-induced adverse events (AEs) in Asians, it remains unclear which variants of NUDT15 or whether additional genetic variants should be tested to predict AEs. To clarify the best pharmacogenetic test to be used clinically, we performed association studies of NUDT15 variants and haplotypes with AEs, genome-wide association study (GWAS) to discover additional variants, and ROC analysis to select the model to predict severe AEs. Overall, 2630 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were enrolled and genotyped for NUDT15 codon 139; 1291 patients were treated with thiopurines. diplotypes were analyzed in 970 patients, and GWASs of AEs were performed with 1221 patients using population-optimized genotyping array and imputation. We confirmed the association of NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys with leukopenia and alopecia (p = 2.20E-63, 1.32E-69, OR = 6.59, 12.1, respectively), and found a novel association with digestive symptoms (p = 6.39E-04, OR = 1.89). Time to leukopenia was significantly shorter, and when leukopenia was diagnosed, thiopurine doses were significantly lower in Arg/Cys and Cys/Cys than in Arg/Arg. In GWASs, no additional variants were found to be associated with thiopurine-induced AEs. Despite strong correlation of leukopenia frequency with estimated enzyme activities based on the diplotypes (r(2) = 0.926, p = 0.0087), there were no significant differences in the AUCs of diplotypes from those of codon 139 to predict severe AEs (AUC = 0.916, 0.921, for acute severe leukopenia, AUC = 0.990, 0.991, for severe alopecia, respectively). Genotyping of NUDT15 codon 139 was sufficient to predict acute severe leukopenia and alopecia in Japanese patients with IBD.	
29931343	Consortium-based genome-wide meta-analysis for childhood dental caries traits.	Prior studies suggest dental caries traits in children and adolescents are partially heritable, but there has been no large-scale consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date. We therefore performed GWAS for caries in participants aged 2.5-18.0 years from nine contributing centres. Phenotype definitions were created for the presence or absence of treated or untreated caries, stratified by primary and permanent dentition. All studies tested for association between caries and genotype dosage and the results were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Analysis included up to 19 003 individuals (7530 affected) for primary teeth and 13 353 individuals (5875 affected) for permanent teeth. Evidence for association with caries status was observed at rs1594318-C for primary teeth [intronic within ALLC, odds ratio (OR) 0.85, effect allele frequency (EAF) 0.60, P 4.13e-8] and rs7738851-A (intronic within NEDD9, OR 1.28, EAF 0.85, P 1.63e-8) for permanent teeth. Consortium-wide estimated heritability of caries was low [h2 of 1% (95% CI: 0%: 7%) and 6% (95% CI 0%: 13%) for primary and permanent dentitions, respectively] compared with corresponding within-study estimates [h2 of 28% (95% CI: 9%: 48%) and 17% (95% CI: 2%: 31%)] or previously published estimates. This study was designed to identify common genetic variants with modest effects which are consistent across different populations. We found few single variants associated with caries status under these assumptions. Phenotypic heterogeneity between cohorts and limited statistical power will have contributed; these findings could also reflect complexity not captured by our study design, such as genetic effects which are conditional on environmental exposure.	
29934777	Targeted resequencing of a locus for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia on chromosome 5 identified in a genome-wide association study.	Immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the clinically most important adverse drug reaction (ADR) in response to heparin therapy characterized by a prothrombotic state despite a decrease in platelet count. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 96 suspected HIT cases and 96 controls to explore the genetic predisposition for HIT within a case-control pharmacovigilance study followed by replication in additional 86 cases and 86 controls from the same study. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs1433265, P = 6.5 × 10(-5), odds ratio (OR) 2.79) from 16 identified SNPs was successfully replicated (P = 1.5 × 10(-4), OR 2.77; combined data set P = 2.7 × 10(-8), OR 2.77) and remained the most strongly associated SNP after imputing locus genotypes. Fine mapping revealed a significantly associated risk-conferring haplotype (P = 4.9 × 10(-6), OR 2.41). In order to find rare variants contributing to the association signals, we applied a targeted resequencing approach in a subgroup of 73 HIT patients and 23 controls for the regions with the 16 most strongly HIT-associated SNPs. C-alpha testing was applied to test for the impact of rare variants and we detected two candidate genes, the discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (DDR1, P = 3.6 × 10(-2)) and the multiple C2 and transmembrane domain containing 2 (MCTP2, P = 4.5 × 10(-2)). For the genes interactor of little elongation complex ELL subunit 1 (ICE1) and a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 16 (ADAMTS16) nearby rs1433265, we identified several missense variants. Although replication in an independent population is warranted, these findings provide a basis for future studies aiming to identify and characterize genetic susceptibility factors for HIT. KEY MESSAGES: We identified and validated a HIT-associated locus on chromosome 5. Targeted NGS analysis for rare variants identifies DDR1 and MCTP2 as novel candidates. In addition, missense variants for ADAMTS16 and ICE1 were identified in the locus.	
29953918	Identification of three novel loci of ALDH2 Gene for Serum Folate levels in a Male Chinese Population by Genome-Wide Association Study.	Serum folate is important in clinical researches and DNA synthesis and methylation. Some loci and genes that are associated with folate levels had been detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), such as rs1801133 in MTHFR and rs1979277 in SHMT1. Nevertheless, only a small part of variants has been clearly identified for serum folate. Hence, we conducted a GWAS to discover new inherited susceptibility and gene-environment interactions on serum folate concentration. In a healthy Chinese population of 1999 men, genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip. Serum folate levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), pathway enrichment analysis and statistical analysis were performed by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Statistic Package for Social Science (SPSS). We validated that rs1801133 in MTHFR was significantly involved in serum folate (P = 4.21 × 10(-19)). Surprisingly, we discovered three novel loci rs3782886, rs671, and rs4646776 of ALDH2 gene were suggestively significantly associated with folate serum folate levels in the male population studied (P = 2.17 × 10(-7), P = 3.60 × 10(-7), P = 3.99 × 10(-7), respectively) after adjusting for population stratification, BMI and age. Men with the AA genotype had significantly higher serum folate levels compared with men with the GG/AG genotype. But we found ALDH2 gene mutation no relation to part of environmental factors on serum folate levels. In a male Chinese population, genome-wide association study discovered that three novel SNPs rs3782886, rs671 and rs4646776 of ALDH2 gene were suggestively significantly associated with serum folate levels.	
29942086	Genome-wide association meta-analysis in 269,867 individuals identifies new genetic and functional links to intelligence.	Intelligence is highly heritable(1) and a major determinant of human health and well-being(2). Recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified 24 genomic loci linked to variation in intelligence(3-7), but much about its genetic underpinnings remains to be discovered. Here, we present a large-scale genetic association study of intelligence (n = 269,867), identifying 205 associated genomic loci (190 new) and 1,016 genes (939 new) via positional mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, chromatin interaction mapping, and gene-based association analysis. We find enrichment of genetic effects in conserved and coding regions and associations with 146 nonsynonymous exonic variants. Associated genes are strongly expressed in the brain, specifically in striatal medium spiny neurons and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Gene set analyses implicate pathways related to nervous system development and synaptic structure. We confirm previous strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization analysis results suggest protective effects of intelligence for Alzheimer's disease and ADHD and bidirectional causation with pleiotropic effects for schizophrenia. These results are a major step forward in understanding the neurobiology of cognitive function as well as genetically related neurological and psychiatric disorders.	
29942085	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for neuroticism in 449,484 individuals identifies novel genetic loci and pathways.	Neuroticism is an important risk factor for psychiatric traits, including depression(1), anxiety(2,3), and schizophrenia(4-6). At the time of analysis, previous genome-wide association studies(7-12) (GWAS) reported 16 genomic loci associated to neuroticism(10-12). Here we conducted a large GWAS meta-analysis (n = 449,484) of neuroticism and identified 136 independent genome-wide significant loci (124 new at the time of analysis), which implicate 599 genes. Functional follow-up analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell types, including dopaminergic neuroblasts (P = 3.49 × 10(-8)), medium spiny neurons (P = 4.23 × 10(-8)), and serotonergic neurons (P = 1.37 × 10(-7)). Gene set analyses implicated three specific pathways: neurogenesis (P = 4.43 × 10(-9)), behavioral response to cocaine processes (P = 1.84 × 10(-7)), and axon part (P = 5.26 × 10(-8)). We show that neuroticism's genetic signal partly originates in two genetically distinguishable subclusters(13) ('depressed affect' and 'worry'), suggesting distinct causal mechanisms for subtypes of individuals. Mendelian randomization analysis showed unidirectional and bidirectional effects between neuroticism and multiple psychiatric traits. These results enhance neurobiological understanding of neuroticism and provide specific leads for functional follow-up experiments.	
29947131	Genome-wide association analysis links multiple psychiatric liability genes to oscillatory brain activity.	Oscillatory activity is crucial for information processing in the brain, and has a long history as a biomarker for psychopathology. Variation in oscillatory activity is highly heritable, but current understanding of specific genetic influences remains limited. We performed the largest genome-wide association study to date of oscillatory power during eyes-closed resting electroencephalogram (EEG) across a range of frequencies (delta 1-3.75 Hz, theta 4-7.75 Hz, alpha 8-12.75 Hz, and beta 13-30 Hz) in 8,425 subjects. Additionally, we performed KGG positional gene-based analysis and brain-expression analyses. GABRA2-a known genetic marker for alcohol use disorder and epilepsy-significantly affected beta power, consistent with the known relation between GABA(A) interneuron activity and beta oscillations. Tissue-specific SNP-based imputation of gene-expression levels based on the GTEx database revealed that hippocampal GABRA2 expression may mediate this effect. Twenty-four genes at 3p21.1 were significant for alpha power (FDR q < .05). SNPs in this region were linked to expression of GLYCTK in hippocampal tissue, and GNL3 and ITIH4 in the frontal cortex-genes that were previously implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In sum, we identified several novel genetic variants associated with oscillatory brain activity; furthermore, we replicated and advanced understanding of previously known genes associated with psychopathology (i.e., schizophrenia and alcohol use disorders). Importantly, these psychopathological liability genes affect brain functioning, linking the genes' expression to specific cortical/subcortical brain regions.	
29959729	A Genome-Wide Association Study of α-Synuclein Levels in Cerebrospinal Fluid.	α-Synuclein is a 140-amino acid protein produced predominantly by neurons in the brain which plays a role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, synaptic function, and plasticity, thus making it the focus in understanding the etiology of a group of neurodegenerative diseases. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of α-synuclein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with 209 non-Hispanic white participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) cohort using a linear regression model to identify novel variants associated with α-synuclein concentration. The minor allele (T) of rs7072338 in the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1515 (LINC01515) and the minor allele (T) of rs17794023 in clusterin-associated protein 1 (CLUAP1) were associated with higher CSF α-synuclein levels at genome-wide significance (P = 4.167 × 10(-9) and 9.56 × 10(-9), respectively). In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) (rs1394839) (P = 2.31 × 10(-7)), Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (RAPGEF1) (rs10901091) (P = 8.07 × 10(-7)), and two intergenic loci on chromosome 2 and 14 (rs11687064 P = 2.50 × 10(-7)and rs7147386 P = 4.05 × 10(-7)) were identified as suggestive loci associated with CSF α-synuclein levels. We have identified significantly associated SNPs for CSF α-synuclein. These associations have important implications for a better understanding of α-synuclein regulation and allow researchers to further explore the relationships between these SNPs and α-synuclein-related neurodegenerative disorders.	
30004843	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Integrative Analysis of Multiomics Data for Biomarker Discovery.	Increased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The development of systems biology technologies for integration of multiomics data is crucial for predicting increased FPG levels. In this case-control study, immunoglobulin (Ig) G glycosylation profiling and genome-wide association analyses were performed on 511 participants, and among them 76 had increased FPG (aged 47.6 ± 6.14 years), and 435 had decreased or fluctuant FPG (aged 47.9 ± 6.08 years). We identified nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five genes (RPL7AP27, SNX30, SLC39A12, BACE2, and IGFL2) that were significantly associated with increased FPG (odds ratios 1.937-2.393). Moreover, of the 24 glycan peaks (GPs), GPs 3, 8, and 11 presented positive trends with increased FPG levels, whereas GPs 4 and 14 presented negative trends. A significant improvement of predictive power was observed when adding 24 IgG GPs to 9 SNPs with the area under the curve increased from 0.75 to 0.81. This report shows that the combination of candidate SNPs with IgG glycomics offers biomarker potentials for T2DM. The substantial predictive power obtained from integrating genomics and glycomics biomarkers suggests the feasibility of applying such multiomics strategies to enable predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine for T2DM.	
30134085	Genome-wide association study of cognitive flexibility assessed by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.	Cognitive flexibility is a critical component of executive function and is strongly influenced by genetic factors. We conducted a genome-wide association study of cognitive flexibility (as measured by perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) in two sets of African American (AA) and European American (EA) subjects (Yale-Penn-1: 1,411 AAs/949 EAs; Yale-Penn-2: 1,178 AAs/1,335 EAs). We examined the association of cognitive flexibility with genotyped or imputed SNPs across the genome. In AAs, two correlated common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7165213/rs35633795) in the downstream region of the noncoding gene LOC101927286 on chromosome 15 showed genome-wide significant (GWS) associations with cognitive flexibility (Yale-Penn-1: p = 6.0 × 10(-9) /1.3 × 10(-8) ; Yale-Penn-2: p = .029/.010; meta-analysis: p = 4.2 × 10(-7) /1.0 × 10(-7) ) in the same effect direction. In EAs, no GWS associations were observed. Enriched gene sets identified by Data-driven Expression-Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits (DEPICT) analysis of the top SNPs (p(meta-analysis)  < 10(-5) ) included the signalosome and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (USP9X) subnetwork in AAs, and abnormal frontal and occipital bone morphology in EAs. We also performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis to examine the genetic correlation of cognition-proxy phenotypes (general cognitive function, education attainment, childhood intelligence, and infant head circumference) and cognitive flexibility in EAs. The PRS derived from general cognitive function-associated SNPs was significantly associated with cognitive flexibility. Nongenetic factors (age, education, sex, and tobacco recency) also exerted significant effects on cognitive flexibility. Our study demonstrates that both genetic and nongenetic factors impact cognitive flexibility, and variants in genes involved in protein degradation and brain development may contribute to population variation in cognitive function.	
30045251	Causal association of body mass index with hypertension using a Mendelian randomization design.	Observational studies have shown that obesity is a major risk factor for hypertension, but unmeasured confounding factors may exist. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal effect of obesity on hypertension.The MR analysis was performed in a well-defined community cohort study of 8832 middle-aged (40-69 years) adults in Korea enrolled from 2001 to 2013. We used baseline hypertension and newly diagnosed hypertension during the 10-year follow-up period as the outcome variable. Genetic risk score associated with body mass index (BMI GRS) was used as the instrumental variable (IV) to measure the causal relationship between obesity and hypertension. The IV estimate of causal odds ratio (OR) was derived using the Wald ratio estimator and then exponentiation to express the result as an OR.In the multivariable model adjusting for age, sex, study area, education, smoking, and current alcohol consumption, each 1 kg/m increase in BMI was associated with a 19% (OR: 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.21) increase in hypertension risk. We selected 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (P < 1.0 × 10) associated with BMI by genome-wide screening using linear regression and created 6 types of GRS. We demonstrated that each standard-deviation increase in BMI GRS was associated with a 5% to 6% (OR: 1.05-1.06) increased risk of hypertension (all P < .05). Using BMI GRS as the IV, we found a causal relationship between BMI and hypertension (OR: 1.13-1.26, all P < .05 except weighted GRS [n = 6]).Using Mendelian randomization, we found that obesity is causally associated with hypertension. This information will have important public health implications, supporting evidence that obesity-reduction programs will reduce the incidence of hypertension.	
29967481	Genetic variants in systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility loci, XKR6 and GLT1D1 are associated with childhood-onset SLE in a Korean cohort.	Impact of genetic variants on the age of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) onset was not fully understood. We investigated a cumulative effect of SLE-risk variants on the age of SLE onset and scanned genome-wide SNPs to search for new risk loci of childhood-onset SLE (cSLE). We analyzed 781 Korean single-center SLE subjects who previously genotyped by both Immunochip and genome-wide SNP arrays. Individual genetic risk scores (GRS) from well-validated SLE susceptibility loci were calculated and tested for their association with cSLE (<16 years at onset). Single-variant association tests were performed using a multivariable logistic regression adjusting for population stratification. GRS from SLE susceptibility loci was significantly higher in cSLE than aSLE (p = 1.23 × 10(-3)). Two SNPs, rs7460469 in XKR6 (p = 1.26 × 10(-8), OR = 5.58) and rs7300146 in GLT1D1 p = 1.49 × 10(-8), OR = 2.85), showed the most significant associations with cSLE. The model consisting of GRS of SLE and two newly identified loci showed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.71 in a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for prediction of cSLE. In conclusion, cSLE is associated with a high cumulative SLE-risk effect and two novel SNPs rs7460469 and rs7300146, providing the first predictive model for cSLE in Koreans.	
29970928	Multi-level genomic analyses suggest new genetic variants involved in human memory.	Development of high-throughput genotyping platforms provides an opportunity to identify new genetic elements related to complex cognitive functions. Taking advantage of multi-level genomic analysis, here we studied the genetic basis of human short-term (STM, n = 1623) and long-term (LTM, n = 1522) memory functions. Heritability estimation based on single nucleotide polymorphism showed moderate (61%, standard error 35%) heritability of short-term memory but almost zero heritability of long-term memory. We further performed a two-step genome-wide association study, but failed to find any SNPs that could pass genome-wide significance and survive replication at the same time. However, suggestive significance for rs7011450 was found in the shared component of the two STM tasks. Further inspections on its nearby gene zinc finger and at-hook domain containing and SNPs around this gene showed suggestive association with STM. In LTM, a polymorphism within branched chain amino acid transaminase 2 showed suggestive significance in the discovery cohort and has been replicated in another independent population of 1862. Furthermore, we performed a pathway analysis based on the current genomic data and found pathways including mTOR signaling and axon guidance significantly associated with STM capacity. These findings warrant further replication in other larger populations.	
29970889	Elucidating the genetic basis of social interaction and isolation.	The negative impacts of social isolation and loneliness on health are well documented. However, little is known about their possible biological determinants. In up to 452,302 UK Biobank study participants, we perform genome-wide association study analyses for loneliness and regular participation in social activities. We identify 15 genomic loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for loneliness, and demonstrate a likely causal association between adiposity and increased susceptibility to loneliness and depressive symptoms. Further loci were identified for regular attendance at a sports club or gym (N = 6 loci), pub or social club (N = 13) or religious group (N = 18). Across these traits there was strong enrichment for genes expressed in brain regions that control emotional expression and behaviour. We demonstrate aetiological mechanisms specific to each trait, in addition to identifying loci that are pleiotropic across multiple complex traits. Further study of these traits may identify novel modifiable risk factors associated with social withdrawal and isolation.	
29971594	Genetic modifiers of radon-induced lung cancer risk: a genome-wide interaction study in former uranium miners.	Radon is a risk factor for lung cancer and uranium miners are more exposed than the general population. A genome-wide interaction analysis was carried out to identify genomic loci, genes or gene sets that modify the susceptibility to lung cancer given occupational exposure to the radioactive gas radon. Samples from 28 studies provided by the International Lung Cancer Consortium were pooled with samples of former uranium miners collected by the German Federal Office of Radiation Protection. In total, 15,077 cases and 13,522 controls, all of European ancestries, comprising 463 uranium miners were compared. The DNA of all participants was genotyped with the OncoArray. We fitted single-marker and in multi-marker models and performed an exploratory gene-set analysis to detect cumulative enrichment of significance in sets of genes. We discovered a genome-wide significant interaction of the marker rs12440014 within the gene CHRNB4 (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.60, p = 0.0386 corrected for multiple testing). At least suggestive significant interaction of linkage disequilibrium blocks was observed at the chromosomal regions 18q21.23 (p = 1.2 × 10(-6)), 5q23.2 (p = 2.5 × 10(-6)), 1q21.3 (p = 3.2 × 10(-6)), 10p13 (p = 1.3 × 10(-5)) and 12p12.1 (p = 7.1 × 10(-5)). Genes belonging to the Gene Ontology term "DNA dealkylation involved in DNA repair" (GO:0006307; p = 0.0139) or the gene family HGNC:476 "microRNAs" (p = 0.0159) were enriched with LD-blockwise significance. The well-established association of the genomic region 15q25 to lung cancer might be influenced by exposure to radon among uranium miners. Furthermore, lung cancer susceptibility is related to the functional capability of DNA damage signaling via ubiquitination processes and repair of radiation-induced double-strand breaks by the single-strand annealing mechanism.	
29973135	Genome-wide association study of nocturnal blood pressure dipping in hypertensive patients.	Reduced nocturnal fall (non-dipping) of blood pressure (BP) is a predictor of cardiovascular target organ damage. No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on BP dipping have been previously reported. To study genetic variation affecting BP dipping, we conducted a GWAS in Genetics of Drug Responsiveness in Essential Hypertension (GENRES) cohort (n = 204) using the mean night-to-day BP ratio from up to four ambulatory BP recordings conducted on placebo. Associations with P < 1 × 10(- 5) were further tested in two independent cohorts: Haemodynamics in Primary and Secondary Hypertension (DYNAMIC) (n = 183) and Dietary, Lifestyle and Genetic determinants of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (DILGOM) (n = 180). We also tested the genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for association with left ventricular hypertrophy in GENRES. In GENRES GWAS, rs4905794 near BCL11B achieved genome-wide significance (β = - 4.8%, P = 9.6 × 10(- 9) for systolic and β = - 4.3%, P = 2.2 × 10(- 6) for diastolic night-to-day BP ratio). Seven additional SNPs in five loci had P values < 1 × 10(- 5). The association of rs4905794 did not significantly replicate, even though in DYNAMIC the effect was in the same direction (β = - 0.8%, P = 0.4 for systolic and β = - 1.6%, P = 0.13 for diastolic night-to-day BP ratio). In GENRES, the associations remained significant even during administration of four different antihypertensive drugs. In separate analysis in GENRES, rs4905794 was associated with echocardiographic left ventricular mass (β = - 7.6 g/m(2), P = 0.02). rs4905794 near BCL11B showed evidence for association with nocturnal BP dipping. It also associated with left ventricular mass in GENRES. Combined with earlier data, our results provide support to the idea that BCL11B could play a role in cardiovascular pathophysiology.	
29975729	Identification of novel susceptibility loci associated with hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance in chronic hepatitis B.	The seroclearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is regarded as a functional cure of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) although it occurs rarely. Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) revealed various genetic alterations related to the clinical course of HBV infection. However, all of these studies focused on the progression of HBV infection to chronicity and had limited application because of the heterogeneity of HBV genotypes. In the present study, we aimed to determine susceptibility genetic markers for seroclearance of HBsAg in CHB patients with a homogenous viral genotype. One hundred patients with CHB who had experienced HBsAg seroclearance before 60 years of age and another 100 with CHB showing high serum levels of HBsAg even after 60 years of age were enrolled. Extreme-phenotype GWAS was conducted using blood samples of participants. We identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs7944135 (P = 4.17 × 10-6, odds ratio [OR] = 4.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.27-7.63) at 11q12.1, rs171941 (P = 3.52×10-6, OR = 3.69, 95% CI = 2.13-6.42) at 5q14.1, and rs6462008 (P = 3.40×10-6, OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.22-0.54) at 7p15.2 as novel susceptibility loci associated with HBsAg seroclearance in patients with CHB. The flanking genes at these loci including MPEG1, DTX4, MTX3, and HOXA13 were suggested to have functional significance. In addition, through functional analysis, CXCL13 was also presumed to be related. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first GWAS regarding the seroclearance of HBsAg in CHB patients. We identify new susceptibility loci for cure of CHB, providing new insights into its pathophysiology.	
30034349	A Deep Learning Approach for Predicting Antidepressant Response in Major Depression Using Clinical and Genetic Biomarkers.	In the wake of recent advances in scientific research, personalized medicine using deep learning techniques represents a new paradigm. In this work, our goal was to establish deep learning models which distinguish responders from non-responders, and also to predict possible antidepressant treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD). To uncover relationships between the responsiveness of antidepressant treatment and biomarkers, we developed a deep learning prediction approach resulting from the analysis of genetic and clinical factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), age, sex, baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, depressive episodes, marital status, and suicide attempt status of MDD patients. The cohort consisted of 455 patients who were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (treatment-response rate = 61.0%; remission rate = 33.0%). By using the SNP dataset that was original to a genome-wide association study, we selected 10 SNPs (including(ABCA13) rs4917029,(BNIP3) rs9419139,(CACNA1E) rs704329,(EXOC4) rs6978272,(GRIN2B) rs7954376,(LHFPL3) rs4352778,(NELL1) rs2139423,(NUAK1) rs2956406,(PREX1) rs4810894, and(SLIT3) rs139863958) which were associated with antidepressant treatment response. Furthermore, we pinpointed 10 SNPs (including(ARNTL) rs11022778,(CAMK1D) rs2724812,(GABRB3) rs12904459,(GRM8) rs35864549,(NAALADL2) rs9878985,(NCALD) rs483986,(PLA2G4A) rs12046378,(PROK2) rs73103153,(RBFOX1) rs17134927, and(ZNF536) rs77554113) in relation to remission. Then, we employed multilayer feedforward neural networks (MFNNs) containing 1-3 hidden layers and compared MFNN models with logistic regression models. Our analysis results revealed that the MFNN model with 2 hidden layers (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.8228 ± 0.0571; sensitivity = 0.7546 ± 0.0619; specificity = 0.6922 ± 0.0765) performed maximally among predictive models to infer the complex relationship between antidepressant treatment response and biomarkers. In addition, the MFNN model with 3 hidden layers (AUC = 0.8060 ± 0.0722; sensitivity = 0.7732 ± 0.0583; specificity = 0.6623 ± 0.0853) achieved best among predictive models to predict remission. Our study indicates that the deep MFNN framework may provide a suitable method to establish a tool for distinguishing treatment responders from non-responders prior to antidepressant therapy.	
29988085	Genome-wide meta-analysis of macronutrient intake of 91,114 European ancestry participants from the cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology consortium.	Macronutrient intake, the proportion of calories consumed from carbohydrate, fat, and protein, is an important risk factor for metabolic diseases with significant familial aggregation. Previous studies have identified two genetic loci for macronutrient intake, but incomplete coverage of genetic variation and modest sample sizes have hindered the discovery of additional loci. Here, we expanded the genetic landscape of macronutrient intake, identifying 12 suggestively significant loci (P < 1 × 10(-6)) associated with intake of any macronutrient in 91,114 European ancestry participants. Four loci replicated and reached genome-wide significance in a combined meta-analysis including 123,659 European descent participants, unraveling two novel loci; a common variant in RARB locus for carbohydrate intake and a rare variant in DRAM1 locus for protein intake, and corroborating earlier FGF21 and FTO findings. In additional analysis of 144,770 participants from the UK Biobank, all identified associations from the two-stage analysis were confirmed except for DRAM1. Identified loci might have implications in brain and adipose tissue biology and have clinical impact in obesity-related phenotypes. Our findings provide new insight into biological functions related to macronutrient intake.	
30003307	Genome-wide association study of coronary artery disease among individuals with diabetes: the UK Biobank.	Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common complication among individuals with diabetes. A better understanding of the genetic background of CAD in this population has the potential to suggest novel molecular targets for screening, risk assessment and drug development. We performed a genome-wide association study of CAD in 15,666 unrelated individuals (3,968 CAD cases and 11,698 controls) of white British ancestry with diabetes at inclusion in the UK Biobank study. Our results were compared with results from participants without diabetes. We found genome-wide significant evidence for association with CAD at the previously well-established LPA locus (lead variant: rs74617384; OR 1.38 [95% CI 1.26, 1.51], p = 3.2 × 10(-12)) and at 9p21 (lead variant: rs10811652; OR 1.19 [95% CI 1.13, 1.26], p = 6.0 × 10(-11)). Moreover, other variants previously associated with CAD showed similar effects in the participants with and without diabetes, indicating that the genetic architecture of CAD is largely the same. Our results indicate large similarities between the genetic architecture of CAD in participants with and without diabetes. Larger studies are needed to establish whether there are important diabetes-specific CAD loci.	
30003630	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of age at first cannabis use.	Cannabis is one of the most commonly used substances among adolescents and young adults. Earlier age at cannabis initiation is linked to adverse life outcomes, including multi-substance use and dependence. This study estimated the heritability of age at first cannabis use and identified associations with genetic variants. A twin-based heritability analysis using 8055 twins from three cohorts was performed. We then carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis of age at first cannabis use in a discovery sample of 24 953 individuals from nine European, North American and Australian cohorts, and a replication sample of 3735 individuals. The twin-based heritability for age at first cannabis use was 38% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 19-60%]. Shared and unique environmental factors explained 39% (95% CI = 20-56%) and 22% (95% CI = 16-29%). The genome-wide association meta-analysis identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 16 within the calcium-transporting ATPase gene (ATP2C2) at P < 5E-08. All five SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2)  > 0.8), with the strongest association at the intronic variant rs1574587 (P = 4.09E-09). Gene-based tests of association identified the ATP2C2 gene on 16q24.1 (P = 1.33e-06). Although the five SNPs and ATP2C2 did not replicate, ATP2C2 has been associated with cocaine dependence in a previous study. ATP2B2, which is a member of the same calcium signalling pathway, has been associated previously with opioid dependence. SNP-based heritability for age at first cannabis use was non-significant. Age at cannabis initiation appears to be moderately heritable in western countries, and individual differences in onset can be explained by separate but correlated genetic liabilities. The significant association between age of initiation and ATP2C2 is consistent with the role of calcium signalling mechanisms in substance use disorders.	
30009487	Genome-wide association study: Exploring the genetic basis for responsiveness to ketogenic dietary therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy.	With the exception of specific metabolic disorders, predictors of response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDTs) are unknown. We aimed to determine whether common variation across the genome influences the response to KDT for epilepsy. We genotyped individuals who were negative for glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome or other metabolic disorders, who received KDT for epilepsy. Genotyping was performed with the Infinium HumanOmniExpressExome Beadchip. Hospital records were used to obtain demographic and clinical data. KDT response (≥50% seizure reduction) at 3-month follow-up was used to dissect out nonresponders and responders. We then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in nonresponders vs responders, using a linear mixed model and correcting for population stratification. Variants with minor allele frequency <0.05 and those that did not pass quality control filtering were excluded. After quality control filtering, the GWAS of 112 nonresponders vs 123 responders revealed an association locus at 6p25.1, 61 kb upstream of CDYL (rs12204701, P = 3.83 × 10(-8) , odds ratio [A] = 13.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.07-44.8). Although analysis of regional linkage disequilibrium around rs12204701 did not strengthen the likelihood of CDYL being the candidate gene, additional bioinformatic analyses suggest it is the most likely candidate. CDYL deficiency has been shown to disrupt neuronal migration and to influence susceptibility to epilepsy in mice. Further exploration with a larger replication cohort is warranted to clarify whether CDYL is the causal gene underlying the association signal.	
30013178	Common variation near IRF6 is associated with IFN-β-induced liver injury in multiple sclerosis.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system treated with disease-modifying therapies, including the biologic, interferon-β (IFN-β). Up to 60% of IFN-β-exposed MS patients develop abnormal biochemical liver test results(1,2), and 1 in 50 experiences drug-induced liver injury(3). Since genomic variation contributes to other forms of drug-induced liver injury(4,5), we aimed to identify biomarkers of IFN-β-induced liver injury using a two-stage genome-wide association study. The rs2205986 variant, previously linked to differential expression of IRF6, surpassed genome-wide significance in the combined two-stage analysis (P = 2.3 × 10(-8), odds ratio = 8.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.6-19.2). Analysis of an independent cohort of IFN-β-treated MS patients identified via electronic medical records showed that rs2205986 was also associated with increased peak levels of aspartate aminotransferase (P = 7.6 × 10(-5)) and alkaline phosphatase (P = 4.9 × 10(-4)). We show that these findings may be applicable to predicting IFN-β-induced liver injury, offering insight into its safer use.	
30012571	Strong Association of the 	(Background) Nephrotic syndrome is the most common cause of chronic glomerular disease in children. Most of these patients develop steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS), but the loci conferring susceptibility to childhood SSNS are mainly unknown.(Methods) We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Japanese population; 224 patients with childhood SSNS and 419 adult healthy controls were genotyped using the Affymetrix Japonica Array in the discovery stage. Imputation for six(HLA) genes ((HLA-A),(-C, -B),(-DRB1),(-DQB1), and(-DPB1)) was conducted on the basis of Japanese-specific references. We performed genotyping for(HLA-DRB1)/-(DQB1) using a sequence-specific oligonucleotide-probing method on a Luminex platform. Whole-genome imputation was conducted using a phased reference panel of 2049 healthy Japanese individuals. Replication was performed in an independent Japanese sample set including 216 patients and 719 healthy controls. We genotyped candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms using the DigiTag2 assay.(Results) The most significant association was detected in the(HLA-DR/DQ) region and replicated (rs4642516 [minor allele G], combined(P)(allelic)=7.84×10(-23); odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.26 to 0.41; rs3134996 [minor allele A], combined(P)(allelic)=1.72×10(-25); OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.37).(HLA-DRB1*08:02) ((Pc)=1.82×10(-9); OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.94 to 3.54) and(HLA-DQB1*06:04) ((Pc)=2.09×10(-12); OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.21) were considered primary(HLA) alleles associated with childhood SSNS.(HLA-DRB1*08:02-DQB1*03:02) ((Pc)=7.01×10(-11); OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 2.46 to 5.29) was identified as the most significant genetic susceptibility factor.(Conclusions) The most significant association with childhood SSNS was detected in the(HLA-DR/DQ) region. Further(HLA) allele/haplotype analyses should enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying SSNS.	
30013184	Genome-wide association and HLA fine-mapping studies identify risk loci and genetic pathways underlying allergic rhinitis.	Allergic rhinitis is the most common clinical presentation of allergy, affecting 400 million people worldwide, with increasing incidence in westernized countries(1,2). To elucidate the genetic architecture and understand the underlying disease mechanisms, we carried out a meta-analysis of allergic rhinitis in 59,762 cases and 152,358 controls of European ancestry and identified a total of 41 risk loci for allergic rhinitis, including 20 loci not previously associated with allergic rhinitis, which were confirmed in a replication phase of 60,720 cases and 618,527 controls. Functional annotation implicated genes involved in various immune pathways, and fine mapping of the HLA region suggested amino acid variants important for antigen binding. We further performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses of allergic sensitization against inhalant allergens and nonallergic rhinitis, which suggested shared genetic mechanisms across rhinitis-related traits. Future studies of the identified loci and genes might identify novel targets for treatment and prevention of allergic rhinitis.	
30014611	Long-range genomic regulators of THBS1 and LTBP4 modify disease severity in duchenne muscular dystrophy.	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disease caused by loss-of-function dystrophin (DMD) mutations in boys, who typically suffer loss of ambulation by age 12. Previously, we reported that coding variants in latent transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-binding protein 4 (LTBP4) were associated with reduced TGFβ signaling and prolonged ambulation (p = 1.0 × 10(-3) ) in DMD patients; this result was subsequently replicated by other groups. In this study, we evaluated whether additional DMD modifier genes are observed using whole-genome association in the original cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing loss of ambulation (LOA) in the same cohort of 253 DMD patients used to detect the candidate association with LTBP4 coding variants. Gene expression and chromatin interaction databases were used to fine-map association signals above the threshold for genome-wide significance. Despite the small sample size, two loci associated with prolonged ambulation met genome-wide significance and were tagged by rs2725797 (chr15, p = 6.6 × 10(-9) ) and rs710160 (chr19, p = 4.7 × 10(-8) ). Gene expression and chromatin interaction data indicated that the latter SNP tags regulatory variants of LTBP4, whereas the former SNP tags regulatory variants of thrombospondin-1 (THBS1): an activator of TGFβ signaling by direct binding to LTBP4 and an inhibitor of proangiogenic nitric oxide signaling. Together with previous evidence implicating LTBP4, the THBS1 modifier locus emphasizes the role that common regulatory variants in gene interaction networks can play in mitigating disease progression in muscular dystrophy.

30012220	Exome-chip meta-analysis identifies novel loci associated with cardiac conduction, including ADAMTS6.	Genome-wide association studies conducted on QRS duration, an electrocardiographic measurement associated with heart failure and sudden cardiac death, have led to novel biological insights into cardiac function. However, the variants identified fall predominantly in non-coding regions and their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify putative functional coding variation associated with changes in the QRS interval duration by combining Illumina HumanExome BeadChip genotype data from 77,898 participants of European ancestry and 7695 of African descent in our discovery cohort, followed by replication in 111,874 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank and deCODE cohorts. We identify ten novel loci, seven within coding regions, including ADAMTS6, significantly associated with QRS duration in gene-based analyses. ADAMTS6 encodes a secreted metalloprotease of currently unknown function. In vitro validation analysis shows that the QRS-associated variants lead to impaired ADAMTS6 secretion and loss-of function analysis in mice demonstrates a previously unappreciated role for ADAMTS6 in connexin 43 gap junction expression, which is essential for myocardial conduction. Our approach identifies novel coding and non-coding variants underlying ventricular depolarization and provides a possible mechanism for the ADAMTS6-associated conduction changes.	
30145303	A genome-wide association study of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in U.S. military veterans.	Death by suicide and suicidal behavior are major concerns among U.S. military veterans; however, no genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies of suicidal behavior have been conducted among U.S. military veterans to date, despite the elevated rate of suicidal behavior observed within this population. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present research was to conduct the first GWAS of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in a large and well-characterized sample of U.S. military veterans. The gene most significantly associated (p = 9.28 × 10(-7)) with suicide attempts was the Potassium Calcium-Activated Channel Subfamily M Regulatory Beta Subunit 2 (KCNMB2) gene, which plays a key role in neuronal excitability. In addition, replication analyses provided additional support for the potential role of the ABI Family Member 3 Binding Protein (ABI3BP) gene in the pathogenesis of suicidal behavior, as numerous nominal associations were found between this gene and both suicide attempts and suicidal ideation. Additional work aimed at replicating and extending these findings is needed.	
30019117	The coexistence of copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a locus can result in distorted calculations of the significance in associating SNPs to disease.	With the recent advance in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) have been extensively reported. Accordingly, the issue of incorrect identification of recombination events that can induce the distortion of multi-allelic or hemizygous variants has received more attention. However, the potential distorted calculation bias or significance of a detected association in a GWAS due to the coexistence of CNVs and SNPs in the same genomic region may remain under-recognized. Here we performed the association study within a congenital scoliosis (CS) cohort whose genetic etiology was recently elucidated as a compound inheritance model, including mostly one rare variant deletion CNV null allele and one common variant non-coding hypomorphic haplotype of the TBX6 gene. We demonstrated that the existence of a deletion in TBX6 led to an overestimation of the contribution of the SNPs on the hypomorphic allele. Furthermore, we generalized a model to explain the calculation bias, or distorted significance calculation for an association study, that can be 'induced' by CNVs at a locus. Meanwhile, overlapping between the disease-associated SNPs from published GWAS and common CNVs (overlap 10%) and pathogenic/likely pathogenic CNVs (overlap 99.69%) was significantly higher than the random distribution (p < 1 × 10(-6) and p = 0.034, respectively), indicating that such co-existence of CNV and SNV alleles might generally influence data interpretation and potential outcomes of a GWAS. We also verified and assessed the influence of colocalizing CNVs to the detection sensitivity of disease-associated SNP variant alleles in another adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) genome-wide association study. We proposed that detecting co-existent CNVs when evaluating the association signals between SNPs and disease traits could improve genetic model analyses and better integrate GWAS with robust Mendelian principles.	
30031151	Noncoding RET variants explain the strong association with Hirschsprung disease in patients without rare coding sequence variant.	The pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease is complex. Although the RET proto-oncogene is the most frequently affected gene in Hirschsprung disease, rare coding sequence variants explain only a small part of Hirschsprung disease cases. We aimed to assess the genetic background of Hirschsprung disease using a genome-wide association analysis combined with sequencing all RET exons in samples from 105 Hirschsprung disease cases (30 familial and 75 sporadic) and 386 controls. As expected, variants in or near RET showed the strongest overall association with Hirschsprung disease and the most statistically significant association was observed when using a recessive genetic model (rs2435357, NC_000010.10:g.43582056T > C; genotype TT, OR = 17.31, P = 1.462 × 10(-21)). Previously published associations in variants in SEMA (rs11766001, NC_000007.13:g.84145202A > C; allele C, OR = 2.268, P = 0.009533) and NRG1 (rs4541858, NC_000008.10:g.32410309A > G; allele G, OR = 1.567, P = 0.015; rs7835688, NC_000008.10:g.32411499G > C; allele C, OR = 1.567, P = 0.015) were also replicated in the genome-wide association analysis. Sequencing revealed a total of 12 exonic RET rare variants. Of these, eight amino acid changing rare variants and two frameshift variants caused or possibly caused Hirschsprung disease. Only a minority of the Hirschsprung disease cases (9/30 familial; 7/75 sporadic) carried one of the rare variants. Excluding the rare variant carriers from the genome-wide association analysis did not appreciably change the association of rs2435357 with Hirschsprung disease. We estimate that approximately two thirds of the sporadic cases may be statistically attributed to the recessive action of the common non-coding RET variants. Thus, even though most cases do not carry rare RET variants, combinations of rare variants and the common non-coding RET variant cause the majority of the cases in our population.	
30079052	Genome-Wide Association Study in Vestibular Neuritis: Involvement of the Host Factor for HSV-1 Replication.	(Objective:) In order to identify genetic variants associated with vestibular neuritis, a common cause of peripheral vertigo with a potential causative link to the reactivation of herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), we conducted a genome-wide association study.(Methods:) Association was assessed using approximately 8 million variants. 131 patients with vestibular neuritis and 2,609 controls of European ancestry were included.(Results:) Genome-wide associations with vestibular neuritis were detected in 4 regions containing protein coding genes assignable to two functional groups: virus hypothesis and insulin metabolism. Genes of set 1 are related to viral processes: nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2 (NR3C2) is a receptor for mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids and was shown to be a host factor for HSV-1 replication. Ankyrin repeat domain 30A (ANKRD30A) encodes a host factor for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. It shows rapid evolution and is induced by interferon stimulation. Mediator complex 30 (MED30), an important member of the mediator complex, has been shown to be involved in replication of HIV-1, a knockdown leading to impaired viral replication. The second set of genes LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha (LMX1A), solute carrier family 30 member 8 (SLC30A8) is associated with insulin metabolism and resistance, a feature of some patients in whom type 2 diabetes is an accompanying comorbidity of vestibular neuritis.(Conclusions:) Using a GWAS approach to evaluate the etiology of vestibular neuritis these findings provide another piece of evidence that it may be caused by a viral inflammation.	
30038396	Gene discovery and polygenic prediction from a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in 1.1 million individuals.	Here we conducted a large-scale genetic association analysis of educational attainment in a sample of approximately 1.1 million individuals and identify 1,271 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs. For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11-13% of the variance in educational attainment and 7-10% of the variance in cognitive performance. This prediction accuracy substantially increases the utility of polygenic scores as tools in research.	
30046033	PR interval genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 50 loci associated with atrial and atrioventricular electrical activity.	Electrocardiographic PR interval measures atrio-ventricular depolarization and conduction, and abnormal PR interval is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation and heart block. Our genome-wide association study of over 92,000 European-descent individuals identifies 44 PR interval loci (34 novel). Examination of these loci reveals known and previously not-yet-reported biological processes involved in cardiac atrial electrical activity. Genes in these loci are over-represented in cardiac disease processes including heart block and atrial fibrillation. Variants in over half of the 44 loci were associated with atrial or blood transcript expression levels, or were in high linkage disequilibrium with missense variants. Six additional loci were identified either by meta-analysis of ~105,000 African and European-descent individuals and/or by pleiotropic analyses combining PR interval with heart rate, QRS interval, and atrial fibrillation. These findings implicate developmental pathways, and identify transcription factors, ion-channel genes, and cell-junction/cell-signaling proteins in atrio-ventricular conduction, identifying potential targets for drug development.	
30049742	Heritability and genome-wide association study of diffusing capacity of the lung.	Although several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have investigated the genetics of pulmonary ventilatory function, little is known about the genetic factors that influence gas exchange. The aim of the study was to investigate the heritability of, and genetic variants associated with the diffusing capacity of the lung.GWAS was performed on diffusing capacity of the lung measured by carbon monoxide uptake ((D)(LCO)) and per alveolar volume ((V)(A)) using the single-breath technique, in 8372 individuals from two population-based cohort studies, the Rotterdam Study and the Framingham Heart Study. Heritability was estimated in related (n=6246) and unrelated (n=3286) individuals.Heritability of(D)(LCO) and(D)(LCO)/(V)(A) ranged between 23% and 28% in unrelated individuals and between 45% and 49% in related individuals. Meta-analysis identified a genetic variant in(ADGRG6) that is significantly associated with(D)(LCO)/(V)(A) Gene expression analysis of(ADGRG6) in human lung tissue revealed a decreased expression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and subjects with decreased(D)(LCO)/(V)(A)(D)(LCO) and(D)(LCO)/(V)(A) are heritable traits, with a considerable proportion of variance explained by genetics. A functional variant in(ADGRG6) gene region was significantly associated with(D)(LCO)/(V)(A) Pulmonary(ADGRG6) expression was decreased in patients with COPD.	
30048462	Identification of 613 new loci associated with heel bone mineral density and a polygenic risk score for bone mineral density, osteoporosis and fracture.	Low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to osteoporosis, and is a risk factor for bone fractures, including stress fractures. Using data from UK Biobank, a genome-wide association study identified 1,362 independent SNPs that clustered into 899 loci of which 613 are new. These data were used to train a genetic algorithm using 22,886 SNPs as predictors and showing a correlation with heel bone mineral density of 0.415. Combining this genetic algorithm with height, weight, age and sex resulted in a correlation with heel bone mineral density of 0.496. Individuals with low scores (2.2% of total) showed a change in BMD of -1.16 T-score units, an increase in risk for osteoporosis of 17.4 fold and an increase in risk for fracture of 1.87 fold. Genetic predictors could assist in the identification of individuals at risk for osteoporosis or fractures.	
30054594	Genome-wide association study of intraocular pressure uncovers new pathways to glaucoma.	Intraocular pressure (IOP) is currently the sole modifiable risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide(1). Both IOP and POAG are highly heritable(2). We report a combined analysis of participants from the UK Biobank (n = 103,914) and previously published data from the International Glaucoma Genetic Consortium (n = 29,578)(3,4) that identified 101 statistically independent genome-wide-significant SNPs for IOP, 85 of which have not been previously reported(4-12). We examined these SNPs in 11,018 glaucoma cases and 126,069 controls, and 53 SNPs showed evidence of association. Gene-based tests implicated an additional 22 independent genes associated with IOP. We derived an allele score based on the IOP loci and loci influencing optic nerve head morphology. In 1,734 people with advanced glaucoma and 2,938 controls, participants in the top decile of the allele score were at increased risk (odds ratio (OR) = 5.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1-7.6) of glaucoma relative to the bottom decile.	
30054556	Genome-wide association study suggests four variants influencing outcomes with ranibizumab therapy in exudative age-related macular degeneration.	To identify factors associated with ranibizumab responses in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a replication study using a total of 919 exudative AMD patients treated with intravitreal ranibizumab in a Japanese population. In the combined analysis of GWAS and the replication study, no loci reached genome-wide significant level; however, we found four variants showed suggestive level of associations with visual loss at month three (rs17822656, rs76150532, rs17296444, and rs75165563: P(combined) < 1.0 × 10(-5)). Of the candidate genes within these loci, three were relevant to VEGF-related pathway (KCNMA1, SOCS2, and OTX2). The proportions of patients who worsened visual acuity were 13.7%, 38.8%, 58.0%, and 80.0% in patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more identified risk variants, respectively. Changes in visual acuity decreased linearly as the number of risk variants increased (P = 1.67 × 10(-12)). The area under the curve using age, baseline visual acuity, and history of previous treatment was 0.607, and improved significantly to 0.713 in combination with identified variants (P < 0.0001). Although further study is needed to confirm their associations, our results offer candidate variants influencing response to ranibizumab therapy.	
30053915	Human genetic variants and age are the strongest predictors of humoral immune responses to common pathogens and vaccines.	Humoral immune responses to infectious agents or vaccination vary substantially among individuals, and many of the factors responsible for this variability remain to be defined. Current evidence suggests that human genetic variation influences (i) serum immunoglobulin levels, (ii) seroconversion rates, and (iii) intensity of antigen-specific immune responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of intrinsic (age and sex), environmental, and genetic factors on the variability of humoral response to common pathogens and vaccines. We characterized the serological response to 15 antigens from common human pathogens or vaccines, in an age- and sex-stratified cohort of 1000 healthy individuals (Milieu Intérieur cohort). Using clinical-grade serological assays, we measured total IgA, IgE, IgG, and IgM levels, as well as qualitative (serostatus) and quantitative IgG responses to cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma gondii, influenza A virus, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B virus. Following genome-wide genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms and imputation, we examined associations between ~ 5 million genetic variants and antibody responses using single marker and gene burden tests. We identified age and sex as important determinants of humoral immunity, with older individuals and women having higher rates of seropositivity for most antigens. Genome-wide association studies revealed significant associations between variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region on chromosome 6 and anti-EBV and anti-rubella IgG levels. We used HLA imputation to fine map these associations to amino acid variants in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRβ1 and HLA-DPβ1, respectively. We also observed significant associations for total IgA levels with two loci on chromosome 2 and with specific KIR-HLA combinations. Using extensive serological testing and genome-wide association analyses in a well-characterized cohort of healthy individuals, we demonstrated that age, sex, and specific human genetic variants contribute to inter-individual variability in humoral immunity. By highlighting genes and pathways implicated in the normal antibody response to frequently encountered antigens, these findings provide a basis to better understand disease pathogenesis.

30054458	Genome-wide association analyses identify 143 risk variants and putative regulatory mechanisms for type 2 diabetes.	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a very common disease in humans. Here we conduct a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with ~16 million genetic variants in 62,892 T2D cases and 596,424 controls of European ancestry. We identify 139 common and 4 rare variants associated with T2D, 42 of which (39 common and 3 rare variants) are independent of the known variants. Integration of the gene expression data from blood (n = 14,115 and 2765) with the GWAS results identifies 33 putative functional genes for T2D, 3 of which were targeted by approved drugs. A further integration of DNA methylation (n = 1980) and epigenomic annotation data highlight 3 genes (CAMK1D, TP53INP1, and ATP5G1) with plausible regulatory mechanisms, whereby a genetic variant exerts an effect on T2D through epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Our study uncovers additional loci, proposes putative genetic regulatory mechanisms for T2D, and provides evidence of purifying selection for T2D-associated variants.	
30060048	GRK5 Is Associated with the Regulation of Methadone Dosage in Heroin Dependence.	There is no countable biomarker for opioid dependence treatment responses thus far. In this study, we recruited Taiwanese methadone maintenance treatment patients to search for genes involving the regulatory mechanisms of methadone dose by genome-wide association analyses. A total of 344 Taiwanese methadone maintenance treatment patients were included in a genome-wide association study. The involvement of GRK5 in opioid dependence was then further confirmed by gene expression study on lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 3 independent age- and gender-matched groups: methadone maintenance treatment patients, medication-free former heroin abusers, and normal controls. The results indicated that GRK5, the gene encoding an enzyme related to μ-opioid receptor desensitization, is associated with methadone dose by additive model of gene-based association analysis (P=6.76×10-5). We found that 6 of the 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the genome-wide genotype platform and 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the 29 additionally selected single nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly associated with methadone maintenance dose in both genotype and allele type (P ≤ .006), especially in patients who tested negative in the urine morphine test. The levels of GRK5 gene expression were similar between methadone maintenance treatment patients and medication-free former heroin abusers. However, the normal controls showed a significantly lower level of GRK5 gene expression than the other groups (P=.019). The results suggested an important role for GRK5 in the regulatory mechanisms of methadone dose and course of heroin dependence.	
30061737	Biobank-driven genomic discovery yields new insight into atrial fibrillation biology.	To identify genetic variation underlying atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, we performed a genome-wide association study of >1,000,000 people, including 60,620 atrial fibrillation cases and 970,216 controls. We identified 142 independent risk variants at 111 loci and prioritized 151 functional candidate genes likely to be involved in atrial fibrillation. Many of the identified risk variants fall near genes where more deleterious mutations have been reported to cause serious heart defects in humans (GATA4, MYH6, NKX2-5, PITX2, TBX5)(1), or near genes important for striated muscle function and integrity (for example, CFL2, MYH7, PKP2, RBM20, SGCG, SSPN). Pathway and functional enrichment analyses also suggested that many of the putative atrial fibrillation genes act via cardiac structural remodeling, potentially in the form of an 'atrial cardiomyopathy'(2), either during fetal heart development or as a response to stress in the adult heart.	
30061609	Multiethnic meta-analysis identifies ancestry-specific and cross-ancestry loci for pulmonary function.	Nearly 100 loci have been identified for pulmonary function, almost exclusively in studies of European ancestry populations. We extend previous research by meta-analyzing genome-wide association studies of 1000 Genomes imputed variants in relation to pulmonary function in a multiethnic population of 90,715 individuals of European (N = 60,552), African (N = 8429), Asian (N = 9959), and Hispanic/Latino (N = 11,775) ethnicities. We identify over 50 additional loci at genome-wide significance in ancestry-specific or multiethnic meta-analyses. Using recent fine-mapping methods incorporating functional annotation, gene expression, and differences in linkage disequilibrium between ethnicities, we further shed light on potential causal variants and genes at known and newly identified loci. Several of the novel genes encode proteins with predicted or established drug targets, including KCNK2 and CDK12. Our study highlights the utility of multiethnic and integrative genomics approaches to extend existing knowledge of the genetics of lung function and clinical relevance of implicated loci.	
30066433	Variation at the TRIM11 locus modifies progressive supranuclear palsy phenotype.	The basis for clinical variation related to underlying progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) pathology is unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic determinants of PSP phenotype. Two independent pathological and clinically diagnosed PSP cohorts were genotyped and phenotyped to create Richardson syndrome (RS) and non-RS groups. We carried out separate logistic regression GWASs to compare RS and non-RS groups and then combined datasets to carry out a whole cohort analysis (RS = 367, non-RS = 130). We validated our findings in a third cohort by referring to data from 100 deeply phenotyped cases from a recent GWAS. We assessed the expression/coexpression patterns of our identified genes and used our data to carry out gene-based association testing. Our lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs564309, showed an association signal in both cohorts, reaching genome-wide significance in our whole cohort analysis (odds ratio = 5.5, 95% confidence interval = 3.2-10.0, p = 1.7 × 10(-9) ). rs564309 is an intronic variant of the tripartite motif-containing protein 11 (TRIM11) gene, a component of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). In our third cohort, minor allele frequencies of surrogate SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with rs564309 replicated our findings. Gene-based association testing confirmed an association signal at TRIM11. We found that TRIM11 is predominantly expressed neuronally, in the cerebellum and basal ganglia. Our study suggests that the TRIM11 locus is a genetic modifier of PSP phenotype and potentially adds further evidence for the UPS having a key role in tau pathology, therefore representing a target for disease-modifying therapies.

30369316	Variants at the APOE /C1/C2/C4 Locus Modulate Cholesterol Efflux Capacity Independently of High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol.	Background Macrophage cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoproteins ( HDLs ) is the first step of reverse cholesterol transport. The cholesterol efflux capacity ( CEC ) of HDL particles is a protective risk factor for coronary artery disease independent of HDL cholesterol levels. Using a genome-wide association study approach, we aimed to identify pathways that regulate CEC in humans. Methods and Results We measured CEC in 5293 French Canadians. We tested the genetic association between 4 CEC measures and genotypes at >9 million common autosomal DNA sequence variants. These analyses yielded 10 genome-wide significant signals ( P<6.25×10(-9)) representing 7 loci. Five of these loci harbor genes with important roles in lipid biology ( CETP , LIPC , LPL , APOA 1/C3/A4/A5, and APOE /C1/C2/C4). Except for the APOE /C1/C2/C4 variant ( rs141622900, P(nonadjusted)=1.0×10(-11); P(adjusted)=8.8×10(-9)), the association signals disappear when correcting for HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The additional 2 significant signals were near the PPP 1 CB / PLB 1 and RBFOX 3/ ENPP 7 genes. In secondary analyses, we considered candidate functional variants for 58 genes implicated in HDL biology, as well as 239 variants associated with blood lipid levels and/or coronary artery disease risk by genome-wide association study . These analyses identified 27 significant CEC associations, implicating 5 additional loci ( GCKR , LIPG , PLTP , PPARA , and TRIB 1). Conclusions Our genome-wide association study identified common genetic variation at the APOE /C1/C2/C4 locus as a major determinant of CEC that acts largely independently of HDL cholesterol. We predict that HDL -based therapies aiming at increasing CEC will be modulated by changes in the expression of apolipoproteins in this gene cluster.	
30067744	Investigating the shared genetics of non-syndromic cleft lip/palate and facial morphology.	There is increasing evidence that genetic risk variants for non-syndromic cleft lip/palate (nsCL/P) are also associated with normal-range variation in facial morphology. However, previous analyses are mostly limited to candidate SNPs and findings have not been consistently replicated. Here, we used polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test for genetic overlap between nsCL/P and seven biologically relevant facial phenotypes. Where evidence was found of genetic overlap, we used bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to test the hypothesis that genetic liability to nsCL/P is causally related to implicated facial phenotypes. Across 5,804 individuals of European ancestry from two studies, we found strong evidence, using PRS, of genetic overlap between nsCL/P and philtrum width; a 1 S.D. increase in nsCL/P PRS was associated with a 0.10 mm decrease in philtrum width (95% C.I. 0.054, 0.146; P = 2x10-5). Follow-up MR analyses supported a causal relationship; genetic variants for nsCL/P homogeneously cause decreased philtrum width. In addition to the primary analysis, we also identified two novel risk loci for philtrum width at 5q22.2 and 7p15.2 in our Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of 6,136 individuals. Our results support a liability threshold model of inheritance for nsCL/P, related to abnormalities in development of the philtrum.	
30068317	Genome-wide association study of lung function and clinical implication in heavy smokers.	The aim of this study is to identify genetic loci associated with post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC and FEV(1), and develop a multi-gene predictive model for lung function in COPD. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC and FEV(1) was performed in 1645 non-Hispanic White European descent smokers. A functional rare variant in SERPINA1 (rs28929474: Glu342Lys) was significantly associated with post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC (p = 1.2 × 10(- 8)) and FEV(1) (p = 2.1 × 10(- 9)). In addition, this variant was associated with COPD (OR = 2.3; p = 7.8 × 10(- 4)) and severity (OR = 4.1; p = 0.0036). Heterozygous subjects (CT genotype) had significantly lower lung function and higher percentage of COPD and more severe COPD than subjects with the CC genotype. 8.6% of the variance of post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC can be explained by SNPs in 10 genes with age, sex, and pack-years of cigarette smoking (P <  2.2 × 10(- 16)). This study is the first to show genome-wide significant association of rs28929474 in SERPINA1 with lung function. Of clinical importance, heterozygotes of rs28929474 (4.7% of subjects) have significantly reduced pulmonary function, demonstrating a major impact in smokers. The multi-gene model is significantly associated with CT-based emphysema and clinical outcome measures of severity. Combining genetic information with demographic and environmental factors will further increase the predictive power for assessing reduced lung function and COPD severity.	
30067105	Thyrotropin receptor antibodies and a genetic hint in antithyroid drug-induced adverse drug reactions.	Antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are known to cause various adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that can lead to treatment complexity and unpredictable risks. With the aim of ensuring safer drug use, we assessed whether thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) titers are associated with ATD-induced cutaneous reactions and/or hepatotoxicity, and examined potential genetic predisposition factors. We compared TRAb titers of 37 Graves' disease (GD) patients who had experienced carbimazole/methimazole-induced cutaneous reactions and/or hepatotoxicity with those of 40 normal individuals, or 78 GD patients without the aforementioned ATD-induced ADRs. We performed a genome-wide association study and/or human leukocyte antigen genotyping on GD patients [first stage (chart reviews): 24 cases with ADRs and 423 controls; second stage (actively recruited): 45 cases with ADRs and 137 controls]. For patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, individuals with higher TRAb titers showed a predisposition to carbimazole/methimazole-induced cutaneous reactions and/or hepatotoxicity, with an estimated odds ratio of 5.19 (cut-off value: 64%). Potential associations with the rs144542704 and rs61893841 on chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively, warrant further genetic association analysis. Our findings support the use of carbimazole/methimazole in patients with low TRAb titers to ensure safer drug use. The identified genetic associations warrant further research.	
30070759	Genome-wide analysis of genetic determinants of circulating factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) activity.	Essentials Knowledge of genetic regulators of plasma factor VII activating protease (FSAP) levels is limited. We performed a genome-wide analysis of variants influencing FSAP activity in Scandinavian cohorts. We replicated an association for Marburg-1 and identified an association for a HABP2 stop variant. We identified a novel locus near ADCY2 as a potential additional regulator of FSAP activity. Background Factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) has roles in both coagulation and fibrinolysis. Recent data indicate its involvement in several other processes, such as vascular remodeling and inflammation. Plasma FSAP activity is highly variable among healthy individuals and, apart from the low-frequency missense variant Marburg-I (rs7080536) in the FSAP-encoding gene HABP2, determinants of this variation are unclear. Objectives To identify novel genetic variants within and outside of the HABP2 locus that influence circulating FSAP activity. Patients/Methods We performed an exploratory genome-wide association study (GWAS) on plasma FSAP activity amongst 3230 Swedish subjects. Directly genotyped rare variants were also analyzed with gene-based tests. Using GWAS, we confirmed the strong association between the Marburg-I variant and FSAP activity. HABP2 was also significant in the gene-based analysis, and remained significant after exclusion of Marburg-I carriers. This was attributable to a rare HABP2 stop variant (rs41292628). Carriers of this stop variant showed a similar reduction in FSAP activity as Marburg-I carriers, and this finding was replicated. A secondary genome-wide significant locus was identified at a 5p15 locus (rs35510613), and this finding requires future replication. This common variant is located upstream of ADCY2, which encodes a protein catalyzing the formation of cAMP. Results and Conclusions This study verified the Marburg-I variant to be a strong regulator of FSAP activity, and identified an HABP2 stop variant with a similar impact on FSAP activity. A novel locus near ADCY2 was identified as a potential additional regulator of FSAP activity.	
30071075	A genome-wide association study of energy intake and expenditure.	Excessive energy intake or insufficient energy expenditure, which result in energy imbalance, contribute to the development of obesity. Obesity-related genes, such as FTO, are associated with energy traits. No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to detect the genetic associations with energy-related traits, including energy intake and energy expenditure, among European-ancestry populations. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide study using pooled GWAS including 12,030 European-ancestry women and 6,743 European-ancestry men to identify genetic variants associated with these two energy traits. We observed a statistically significant genome-wide SNP heritability for energy intake of 6.05% (95%CI = (1.76, 10.34), P = 0.006); the SNP heritability for expenditure was not statistically significantly greater than zero. We discovered three SNPs on chromosome 12q13 near gene ANKRD33 that were genome-wide significantly associated with increased total energy intake among all men. We also identified signals on region 2q22 that were associated with energy expenditure among lean people. Body mass index related SNPs were found to be significantly associated with energy intake and expenditure through SNP set analyses. Larger GWAS studies of total energy traits are warranted to explore the genetic basis of energy intake, including possible differences between men and women, and the association between total energy intake and other downstream phenotypes, such as diabetes and chronic diseases.	
30072576	Co-regulatory networks of human serum proteins link genetics to disease.	Proteins circulating in the blood are critical for age-related disease processes; however, the serum proteome has remained largely unexplored. To this end, 4137 proteins covering most predicted extracellular proteins were measured in the serum of 5457 Icelanders over 65 years of age. Pairwise correlation between proteins as they varied across individuals revealed 27 different network modules of serum proteins, many of which were associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease states, as well as overall survival. The protein modules were controlled by cis- and trans-acting genetic variants, which in many cases were also associated with complex disease. This revealed co-regulated groups of circulating proteins that incorporated regulatory control between tissues and demonstrated close relationships to past, current, and future disease states.	
30073298	Role of the Complement System in Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy: A Genome-Wide Association Study.	To date, several targeted genetic studies on chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSC) have been performed; however, unbiased genome-wide studies into the genetics of cCSC have not been reported. To discover new genetic loci associated with cCSC and to better understand the causative mechanism of this disease, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on patients with cCSC. To discover new genetic loci and pathways associated with cCSC and to predict the association of genetic variants with gene expression in patients with cCSC. This case-control GWAS was completed in the general community, 3 referral university medical centers, and outpatient care on Europeans individuals with cCSC and population-based control participants. Genotype data was collected from May 2013 to August 2017, and data analysis occurred from August 2017 to November 2017. Associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, haplotypes, genetic pathways, and predicted gene expression with cCSC. A total of 521 patients with cCSC (median age, 51 years; interquartile range [IQR], 44-59 years; 420 [80.6%] male) and 3577 European population-based control participants (median age, 52 years; IQR, 37-71 years; 1630 [45.6%] male) were included. One locus on chromosome 1 at the complement factor H (CFH) gene reached genome-wide significance and was associated with an increased risk of cCSC (rs1329428; odds ratio [OR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.38-1.80]; P = 3.12 × 10-11). The CFH haplotypes H1 and H3 were protective for cCSC (H1: OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.53-0.77]; P = 2.18 × 10-6; H3: OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.42-0.70]; P = 2.49 × 10-6), whereas haplotypes H2, H4, H5, and the aggregate of rare CFH haplotypes conferred increased risk (H2: OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30-1.89]; P = 2.18 × 10-6; H4: OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.13-1.80]; P = 2.49 × 10-3; H5: OR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.36-2.39]; P = 4.61 × 10-5; rare haplotypes: OR, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.43-2.77]; P = 4.59 × 10-5). Pathway analyses showed involvement of the complement cascade and alternative open reading frame (ARF) pathway in cCSC. Using PrediXcan, we identified changes in predicted expression of complement genes CFH, complement factor H related 1 (CFHR1), complement factor related 4 (CFHR4), and membrane cofactor protein (MCP/CD46). Additionally, the potassium sodium-activated channel subfamily T member 2 (KCNT2) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10a (TNFRSF10A) genes were differentially expressed in patients with cCSC. In this GWAS on cCSC, we identified a locus on chromosome 1 at the CFH gene that was significantly associated with cCSC, and we report protective and risk-conferring haplotypes in this gene. Pathway analyses were enriched for complement genes, and gene expression analysis suggests a role for CFH, CFHR1, CFHR4, CD46, KCNT2, and TNFRSF10A in the disease. Taken together, these results underscore the potential importance of the complement pathway in the causative mechanisms of cCSC.	
30099483	Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Distinct Genetic Susceptibility of Thyroid Nodules From Thyroid Cancer.	Thyroid nodules are very common, and 7% to 15% of them are diagnosed as thyroid cancer. However, the inherited genetic risk factors for thyroid nodules and their associations with thyroid cancer remain unknown. To identify the genetic variants associated with susceptibility to thyroid nodules in comparison with thyroid cancer. We performed a three-stage genome-wide association study for thyroid nodules. The discovery stage involved a genome-wide scan of 811 subjects with thyroid nodules and 691 subjects with a normal thyroid from a population-based cohort. Replication studies were conducted in an additional 1981 cases and 3100 controls from the participants of a health checkup. We also performed expression quantitative trait loci analysis of public data. The most robust association was observed in TRPM3 (rs4745021) in the joint analysis (OR, 1.26; P = 6.12 × 10-8) and meta-analysis (OR, 1.28; P = 2.11 × 10-8). Signals at MBIP/NKX2-1 were replicated but did not reach genome-wide significance in the joint analysis (rs2415317, P = 4.62 × 10-5; rs944289, P = 8.68 × 10-5). The expression quantitative trait loci analysis showed that TRPM3 expression was associated with the rs4745021 genotype in thyroid tissues. To the best of our knowledge, we have performed the first genome-wide association study of thyroid nodules and identified a susceptibility locus associated with thyroid nodules, suggesting that thyroid nodules have a genetic predisposition distinct from that of thyroid cancer.	
30087447	Association of modifiers and other genetic factors explain Marfan syndrome clinical variability.	Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder related to variants in the FBN1 gene. Prognosis is related to aortic risk of dissection following aneurysm. MFS clinical variability is notable, for age of onset as well as severity and number of clinical manifestations. To identify genetic modifiers, we combined genome-wide approaches in 1070 clinically well-characterized FBN1 disease-causing variant carriers: (1) an FBN1 eQTL analysis in 80 fibroblasts of FBN1 stop variant carriers, (2) a linkage analysis, (3) a kinship matrix association study in 14 clinically concordant and discordant sib-pairs, (4) a genome-wide association study and (5) a whole exome sequencing in 98 extreme phenotype samples.Three genetic mechanisms of variability were found. A new genotype/phenotype correlation with an excess of loss-of-cysteine variants (P = 0.004) in severely affected subjects. A second pathogenic event in another thoracic aortic aneurysm gene or the COL4A1 gene (known to be involved in cerebral aneurysm) was found in nine individuals. A polygenic model involving at least nine modifier loci (named gMod-M1-9) was observed through cross-mapping of results. Notably, gMod-M2 which co-localizes with PRKG1, in which activating variants have already been described in thoracic aortic aneurysm, and gMod-M3 co-localized with a metalloprotease (proteins of extra-cellular matrix regulation) cluster. Our results represent a major advance in understanding the complex genetic architecture of MFS and provide the first steps toward prediction of clinical evolution.	
30087453	Examination of the shared genetic basis of anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Anorexia nervosa (AN) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are often comorbid and likely to share genetic risk factors. Hence, we examine their shared genetic background using a cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis of 3495 AN cases, 2688 OCD cases, and 18,013 controls. We confirmed a high genetic correlation between AN and OCD (r(g) = 0.49 ± 0.13, p = 9.07 × 10(-7)) and a sizable SNP heritability (SNP h(2) = 0.21 ± 0.02) for the cross-disorder phenotype. Although no individual loci reached genome-wide significance, the cross-disorder phenotype showed strong positive genetic correlations with other psychiatric phenotypes (e.g., r(g) = 0.36 with bipolar disorder and 0.34 with neuroticism) and negative genetic correlations with metabolic phenotypes (e.g., r(g) = -0.25 with body mass index and -0.20 with triglycerides). Follow-up analyses revealed that although AN and OCD overlap heavily in their shared risk with other psychiatric phenotypes, the relationship with metabolic and anthropometric traits is markedly stronger for AN than for OCD. We further tested whether shared genetic risk for AN/OCD was associated with particular tissue or cell-type gene expression patterns and found that the basal ganglia and medium spiny neurons were most enriched for AN-OCD risk, consistent with neurobiological findings for both disorders. Our results confirm and extend genetic epidemiological findings of shared risk between AN and OCD and suggest that larger GWASs are warranted.	
30089514	Joint genome-wide association study of progressive supranuclear palsy identifies novel susceptibility loci and genetic correlation to neurodegenerative diseases.	Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disease for which the genetic contribution is incompletely understood. We conducted a joint analysis of 5,523,934 imputed SNPs in two newly-genotyped progressive supranuclear palsy cohorts, primarily derived from two clinical trials (Allon davunetide and NNIPPS riluzole trials in PSP) and a previously published genome-wide association study (GWAS), in total comprising 1646 cases and 10,662 controls of European ancestry. We identified 5 associated loci at a genome-wide significance threshold P < 5 × 10(- 8), including replication of 3 loci from previous studies and 2 novel loci at 6p21.1 and 12p12.1 (near RUNX2 and SLCO1A2, respectively). At the 17q21.31 locus, stepwise regression analysis confirmed the presence of multiple independent loci (localized near MAPT and KANSL1). An additional 4 loci were highly suggestive of association (P < 1 × 10(- 6)). We analyzed the genetic correlation with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, and found that PSP had shared polygenic heritability with Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In total, we identified 6 additional significant or suggestive SNP associations with PSP, and discovered genetic overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases. These findings clarify the pathogenesis and genetic architecture of PSP.	
30093612	Identification of nine new susceptibility loci for endometrial cancer.	Endometrial cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer of the female reproductive tract in developed countries. Through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we have previously identified eight risk loci for endometrial cancer. Here, we present an expanded meta-analysis of 12,906 endometrial cancer cases and 108,979 controls (including new genotype data for 5624 cases) and identify nine novel genome-wide significant loci, including a locus on 12q24.12 previously identified by meta-GWAS of endometrial and colorectal cancer. At five loci, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses identify candidate causal genes; risk alleles at two of these loci associate with decreased expression of genes, which encode negative regulators of oncogenic signal transduction proteins (SH2B3 (12q24.12) and NF1 (17q11.2)). In summary, this study has doubled the number of known endometrial cancer risk loci and revealed candidate causal genes for future study.	
30093639	Genome-wide association study identifies multiple new loci associated with Ewing sarcoma susceptibility.	Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a pediatric cancer characterized by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion. We performed a genome-wide association study of 733 EWS cases and 1346 unaffected individuals of European ancestry. Our study replicates previously reported susceptibility loci at 1p36.22, 10q21.3 and 15q15.1, and identifies new loci at 6p25.1, 20p11.22 and 20p11.23. Effect estimates exhibit odds ratios in excess of 1.7, which is high for cancer GWAS, and striking in light of the rarity of EWS cases in familial cancer syndromes. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses identify candidate genes at 6p25.1 (RREB1) and 20p11.23 (KIZ). The 20p11.22 locus is near NKX2-2, a highly overexpressed gene in EWS. Interestingly, most loci reside near GGAA repeat sequences and may disrupt binding of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein. The high locus to case discovery ratio from 733 EWS cases suggests a genetic architecture in which moderate risk SNPs constitute a significant fraction of risk.	
30102679	Genomewide Association Study of Leisure-Time Exercise Behavior in Japanese Adults.	Although several genetic factors may play a role in leisure-time exercise behavior, there is currently no evidence of a significant genomewide association, and candidate gene replication studies have produced inconsistent results. We conducted a two-stage genomewide association study and candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) association study on leisure-time exercise behavior using 13,980 discovery samples from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) study, and 2036 replication samples from the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center-2 study. Leisure-time physical activity was measured using a self-administered questionnaire that inquired about the type, frequency and duration of exercise. Participants with ≥4 MET·h·wk of leisure-time physical activity were defined as exhibiting leisure-time exercise behavior. Association testing using mixed linear regression models was performed on the discovery and replication samples, after which the results were combined in a meta-analysis. In addition, we tested six candidate genetic variants derived from previous genomewide association study. We found that one novel SNP (rs10252228) located in the intergenic region between NPSR1 and DPY19L1 was significantly associated with leisure-time exercise behavior in discovery samples. This association was also significant in replication samples (combined P value by meta-analysis = 2.2 × 10). Several SNP linked with rs10252228 were significantly associated with gene expression of DPY19L1 and DP19L2P1 in skeletal muscle, heart, whole blood, and the nervous system. Among the candidate SNP, rs12612420 in DNAPTP6 demonstrated nominal significance in discovery samples but not in replication samples. We identified a novel genetic variant associated with regular leisure-time exercise behavior. Further functional studies are required to validate the role of these variants in exercise behavior.	
30102696	A genome-wide association study identifies a susceptibility locus for biliary atresia on 2p16.1 within the gene EFEMP1.	Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare pediatric cholangiopathy characterized by fibrosclerosing obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventual liver failure. The etiology of BA remains unknown, although environmental, inflammatory, infectious, and genetic risk factors have been proposed. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a European-American cohort of 343 isolated BA patients and 1716 controls to identify genetic loci associated with BA. A second GWAS was performed in an independent European-American cohort of 156 patients with BA and other extrahepatic anomalies and 212 controls to confirm the identified candidate BA-associated SNPs. Meta-analysis revealed three genome-wide significant BA-associated SNPs on 2p16.1 (rs10865291, rs6761893, and rs727878; P < 5 ×10-8), located within the fifth intron of the EFEMP1 gene, which encodes a secreted extracellular protein implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell proliferation, and organogenesis. RNA expression analysis showed an increase in EFEMP1 transcripts from human liver specimens isolated from patients with either BA or other cholestatic diseases when compared to normal control liver samples. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that EFEMP1 is expressed in cholangiocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in liver specimens from patients with BA and other cholestatic diseases, but it is absent from cholangiocytes in normal control liver samples. Efemp1 transcripts had higher expression in cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts as compared with other cell types in normal rat liver. The identification of a novel BA-associated locus, and implication of EFEMP1 as a new BA candidate susceptibility gene, could provide new insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying this severe pediatric disorder.	
30103242	Genome-Wide Association Study Links Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Sprouty 2 to Thrombocytopenia after Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery.	 Thrombocytopenia after cardiac surgery independently predicts stroke, acute kidney injury and death. To understand the underlying risks and mechanisms, we analysed genetic variations associated with thrombocytopenia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.  Study subjects underwent isolated on-pump CABG surgery at Duke University Medical Center. Post-operative thrombocytopenia was defined as platelet count < 100 × 10(9)/L. Using a logistic regression model adjusted for clinical risk factors, we performed a genome-wide association study in a discovery cohort ((n) = 860) and validated significant findings in a replication cohort ((n) = 296). Protein expression was assessed in isolated platelets by immunoblot.  A total of 63 single-nucleotide polymorphisms met a priori discovery thresholds for replication, but only 1 (rs9574547) in the intergenic region upstream of sprouty 2 ((SPRY2)) met nominal significance in the replication cohort. The minor allele of rs9574547 was associated with a lower risk for thrombocytopenia (discovery cohort, odds ratio, 0.45, 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.67,(p) = 9.76 × 10(-5)) with the overall association confirmed by meta-analysis (meta-(p) = 7.88 × 10(-6)). Immunoblotting demonstrated expression of SPRY2 and its dynamic regulation during platelet activation. Treatment with a functional SPRY2 peptide blunted platelet extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation after agonist stimulation.  We identified the association of a genetic polymorphism in the intergenic region of(SPRY2) with a decreased incidence of thrombocytopenia after CABG surgery. Because(SPRY2)-an endogenous receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor-is present in platelets and modulates essential signalling pathways, these findings support a role for(SPRY2) as a novel modulator of platelet responses after cardiac surgery.	
30104567	Identification of susceptibility pathways for the role of chromosome 15q25.1 in modifying lung cancer risk.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified the chromosome 15q25.1 locus as a leading susceptibility region for lung cancer. However, the pathogenic pathways, through which susceptibility SNPs within chromosome 15q25.1 affects lung cancer risk, have not been explored. We analyzed three cohorts with GWAS data consisting 42,901 individuals and lung expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data on 409 individuals to identify and validate the underlying pathways and to investigate the combined effect of genes from the identified susceptibility pathways. The KEGG neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway, two Reactome pathways, and 22 Gene Ontology terms were identified and replicated to be significantly associated with lung cancer risk, with P values less than 0.05 and FDR less than 0.1. Functional annotation of eQTL analysis results showed that the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway and gated channel activity were involved in lung cancer risk. These pathways provide important insights for the etiology of lung cancer.	
30108155	Genome-wide association study identifies novel recessive genetic variants for high TGs in an Arab population.	Abnormal blood lipid levels are influenced by genetic and lifestyle/dietary factors. Although many genetic variants associated with blood lipid traits have been identified in Europeans, similar data in Middle Eastern populations are limited. We performed a genome-wide association study with Arab individuals (discovery cohort: 1,353; replication cohort: 1,176) from Kuwait to identify possible associations of genetic variants with high lipid levels. We used Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip and candidate SNP genotyping in the discovery and replication phases, respectively. For association tests, we used genetic models that were based on additive and recessive modes of inheritance. High triglycerides (TGs) were recessively associated with six risk variants (rs1002487/(RPS6KA1), rs11805972/(LAD1)) rs7761746/(Or5v1), rs39745/(CTTNBP2)-(LSM8), rs2934952/(PGAP3), and rs9626773/(RP11-191L9.4)-(CERK)) at genome-wide significance ((P)  6.12E-09), and another six variants (rs10873925/(ST6GALNAC5), rs4663379/(SPP2-ARL4C), rs10033119/(NPY1R), rs17709449/(LINC00911)-(FLRT2), rs11654954/(CDK12-NEUROD2), and rs9972882/(STARD3)) were associated at borderline significance ((P)  5.0E-08). High TG was also additively associated with rs11654954. All of the 12 identified markers are novel and are harbored in runs of homozygosity. Literature evidence supports the involvement of these gene loci in lipid-related processes. This study in an Arab population augments international efforts to identify genetic regulation of lipid traits.	
30120083	Genome-Wide Association Study of Circadian Rhythmicity in 71,500 UK Biobank Participants and Polygenic Association with Mood Instability.	Circadian rhythms are fundamental to health and are particularly important for mental wellbeing. Disrupted rhythms of rest and activity are recognised as risk factors for major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of low relative amplitude (RA), an objective measure of rest-activity cycles derived from the accelerometer data of 71,500 UK Biobank participants. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for low RA were used to investigate potential associations with psychiatric phenotypes. Two independent genetic loci were associated with low RA, within genomic regions for Neurofascin (NFASC) and Solute Carrier Family 25 Member 17 (SLC25A17). A secondary GWAS of RA as a continuous measure identified a locus within Meis Homeobox 1 (MEIS1). There were no significant genetic correlations between low RA and any of the psychiatric phenotypes assessed. However, PRS for low RA was significantly associated with mood instability across multiple PRS thresholds (at PRS threshold 0·05: OR = 1·02, 95% CI = 1·01-1·02, p = 9·6 × 10(-5)), and with major depressive disorder (at PRS threshold 0·1: OR = 1·03, 95% CI = 1·01-1·05, p = 0·025) and neuroticism (at PRS threshold 0·5: Beta = 0·02, 95% CI = 0·007-0·04, p = 0·021). Overall, our findings contribute new knowledge on the complex genetic architecture of circadian rhythmicity and suggest a putative biological link between disrupted circadian function and mood disorder phenotypes, particularly mood instability, but also major depressive disorder and neuroticism.

30108283	A study of Kibbutzim in Israel reveals risk factors for cardiometabolic traits and subtle population structure.	Genetic studies in isolated populations often increase power for identifying loci associated with complex diseases and traits. We present here the Kibbutzim Family Study (KFS), aimed at investigating the genetic basis of cardiometabolic traits in extended Israeli families characterized by long-term social stability and a homogeneous environment. Extensive information on cardiometabolic traits, as well as genome-wide genotypes, were collected on 901 individuals. We observed that most KFS participants were of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) genetic origin, confirmed a recent severe bottleneck in the AJ recent history, and detected a subtle within-AJ population structure. Focusing on genetic variants relatively common in the KFS but very rare in Europeans, we observed that AJ-enriched variants appear in cancer-related pathways more than expected by chance. We conducted an association study of the AJ-enriched variants against 16 cardiometabolic traits, and found seven loci (24 variants) to be significantly associated. The strongest association, which we also replicated in an independent study, was between a variant upstream of MSRA (frequency ≈1% in the KFS and nearly absent in Europeans) and weight (P = 3.6∙10(-8)). In conclusion, the KFS is a valuable resource for the study of the population genetics of Israel as well as the genetics of cardiometabolic traits.	
30108127	A Large Multiethnic Genome-Wide Association Study of Adult Body Mass Index Identifies Novel Loci.	Body mass index (BMI), a proxy measure for obesity, is determined by both environmental (including ethnicity, age, and sex) and genetic factors, with > 400 BMI-associated loci identified to date. However, the impact, interplay, and underlying biological mechanisms among BMI, environment, genetics, and ancestry are not completely understood. To further examine these relationships, we utilized 427,509 calendar year-averaged BMI measurements from 100,418 adults from the single large multiethnic Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We observed substantial independent ancestry and nationality differences, including ancestry principal component interactions and nonlinear effects. To increase the list of BMI-associated variants before assessing other differences, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in GERA, with replication in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropomorphic Traits (GIANT) consortium combined with the UK Biobank (UKB), followed by GWAS in GERA combined with GIANT, with replication in the UKB. We discovered 30 novel independent BMI loci ((P) < 5.0 × 10(-8)) that replicated. We then assessed the proportion of BMI variance explained by sex in the UKB using previously identified loci compared to previously and newly identified loci and found slight increases: from 3.0 to 3.3% for males and from 2.7 to 3.0% for females. Further, the variance explained by previously and newly identified variants decreased with increasing age in the GERA and UKB cohorts, echoed in the variance explained by the entire genome, which also showed gene-age interaction effects. Finally, we conducted a tissue expression QTL enrichment analysis, which revealed that GWAS BMI-associated variants were enriched in the cerebellum, consistent with prior work in humans and mice.	
30111768	Genome-wide mapping of plasma protein QTLs identifies putatively causal genes and pathways for cardiovascular disease.	Identifying genetic variants associated with circulating protein concentrations (protein quantitative trait loci; pQTLs) and integrating them with variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may illuminate the proteome's causal role in disease and bridge a knowledge gap regarding SNP-disease associations. We provide the results of GWAS of 71 high-value cardiovascular disease proteins in 6861 Framingham Heart Study participants and independent external replication. We report the mapping of over 16,000 pQTL variants and their functional relevance. We provide an integrated plasma protein-QTL database. Thirteen proteins harbor pQTL variants that match coronary disease-risk variants from GWAS or test causal for coronary disease by Mendelian randomization. Eight of these proteins predict new-onset cardiovascular disease events in Framingham participants. We demonstrate that identifying pQTLs, integrating them with GWAS results, employing Mendelian randomization, and prospectively testing protein-trait associations holds potential for elucidating causal genes, proteins, and pathways for cardiovascular disease and may identify targets for its prevention and treatment.	
30113228	Ancestry and genetic associations with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants is a common and often severe lung disease with long-term sequelae. A genetic component is suspected but not fully defined. We performed an ancestry and genome-wide association study to identify variants, genes, and pathways associated with survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia in 387 high-risk infants treated with inhaled nitric oxide in the Trial of Late Surfactant study. Global African genetic ancestry was associated with increased survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia among infants of maternal self-reported Hispanic white race/ethnicity [odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, P = 0.01]. Admixture mapping found suggestive outcome associations with local African ancestry at chromosome bands 18q21 and 10q22 among infants of maternal self-reported African-American race/ethnicity. For all infants, the top individual variant identified was within the intron of NBL1, which is expressed in midtrimester lung and is an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins ( rs372271081 , OR = 0.17, P = 7.4 × 10(-7)). The protective allele of this variant was significantly associated with lower nitric oxide metabolites in the urine of non-Hispanic white infants ( P = 0.006), supporting a role in the racial differential response to nitric oxide. Interrogating genes upregulated in bronchopulmonary dysplasia lungs indicated association with variants in CCL18, a cytokine associated with fibrosis and interstitial lung disease, and pathway analyses implicated variation in genes involved in immune/inflammatory processes in response to infection and mechanical ventilation. Our results suggest that genetic variation related to lung development, drug metabolism, and immune response contribute to individual and racial/ethnic differences in respiratory outcomes following inhaled nitric oxide treatment of high-risk premature infants.	
30116032	Genetics of suicide attempts in individuals with and without mental disorders: a population-based genome-wide association study.	Family studies have shown an aggregation of suicidal behavior in families. Yet, molecular studies are needed to identify loci accounting for genetic heritability. We conducted a genome-wide association study and estimated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) heritability for a suicide attempt. In a case-cohort study, national data on all individuals born in Denmark after 1981 and diagnosed with severe mental disorders prior to 2013 (n = 57,377) and individuals from the general population (n = 30,000) were obtained. After quality control, the sample consisted of 6024 cases with an incidence of suicide attempt and 44,240 controls with no record of a suicide attempt. Suggestive associations between SNPs, rs6880062 (p-value: 5.4 × 10(-8)) and rs6880461 (p-value: 9.5 × 10(-8)), and suicide attempt were identified when adjusting for socio-demographics. Adjusting for mental disorders, three significant associations, all on chromosome 20, were identified: rs4809706 (p-value: 2.8 × 10(-8)), rs4810824 (p-value: 3.5 × 10(-8)), and rs6019297 (p-value: 4.7 × 10(8)). Sub-group analysis of cases with affective disorders revealed SNPs associated with suicide attempts when compared to the general population for gene PDE4B. All SNPs explained 4.6% [CI-95: 2.9-6.3%] of the variation in suicide attempt. Controlling for mental disorders reduced the heritability to 1.9% [CI-95: 0.3-3.5%]. Affective and autism spectrum disorders exhibited a SNP heritability of 5.6% [CI-95: 1.9-9.3%] and 9.6% [CI-95: 1.1-18.1%], respectively. Using the largest sample to date, we identified significant SNP associations with suicide attempts and support for a genetic transmission of suicide attempt, which might not solely be explained by mental disorders.	
30174134	Genome-wide variants of Eurasian facial shape differentiation and a prospective model of DNA based face prediction.	It is a long-standing question as to which genes define the characteristic facial features among different ethnic groups. In this study, we use Uyghurs, an ancient admixed population to query the genetic bases why Europeans and Han Chinese look different. Facial traits were analyzed based on high-dense 3D facial images; numerous biometric spaces were examined for divergent facial features between European and Han Chinese, ranging from inter-landmark distances to dense shape geometrics. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted on a discovery panel of Uyghurs. Six significant loci were identified, four of which, rs1868752, rs118078182, rs60159418 at or near UBASH3B, COL23A1, PCDH7 and rs17868256 were replicated in independent cohorts of Uyghurs or Southern Han Chinese. A prospective model was also developed to predict 3D faces based on top GWAS signals and tested in hypothetic forensic scenarios.	
30120429	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a cohort of significantly obese women without cardiometabolic diseases.	Obesity is an important risk factor for the development of diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; however, a small number of individuals with long-standing obesity do not present with these cardiometabolic diseases. Such individuals are referred to as metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and potentially represent a subgroup of the general population with a protective genetic predisposition to obesity-related diseases. We hypothesized that individuals who were metabolically healthy, but significantly obese (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2)) would represent a highly homogenous subgroup, with which to investigate potential genetic associations to obesity. We further hypothesized that such a cohort may lend itself well to investigate potential genotypes that are protective with respect to the development of cardiometabolic disease. In the present study, we implemented this novel selection strategy by screening 892 individuals diagnosed as Class 2 or Class 3 obese and identified 38 who presented no manifestations of cardiometabolic disease. We then assessed these subjects for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associated with this phenotype. Our analysis identified 89 SNPs that reach statistical significance (p < 1 × 10(-5)), some of which are associated with genes of biological pathways that influences dietary behavior; others are associated with genes previously linked to obesity and cardiometabolic disease as well as neuroimmune disease. This study, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first genetic screening of a cardiometabolically healthy, but significantly obese population.	
30120336	Genome-wide Association Analysis of Eye Movement Dysfunction in Schizophrenia.	Eye movements are considered endophenotypes of schizophrenia. However, the genetic factors underlying eye movement are largely unknown. In this study, we explored the susceptibility loci for four eye movement scores: the scanpath length during the free viewing test (SPL), the horizontal position gain during the fast Lissajous paradigm of the smooth pursuit test (HPG), the duration of fixations during the far distractor paradigm of the fixation stability test (DF) and the integrated eye movement score of those three scores (EMS). We found 16 SNPs relevant to the HPG that were located in 3 genomic regions (1q21.3, 7p12.1 and 20q13.12) in the patient group; however, these SNPs were intronic or intergenic SNPs. To determine whether these SNPs occur in functional non-coding regions (i.e., enhancer or promoter regions), we examined the chromatin status on the basis of publicly available epigenomic data from 127 tissues or cell lines. This analysis suggested that the SNPs on 1q21.3 and 20q13.12 are in enhancer or promoter regions. Moreover, we performed an analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in human brain tissues using a public database. Finally, we identified significant eQTL effects for all of the SNPs at 1q21.3 and 20q13.12 in particular brain regions.	
30120420	Identification of novel loci associated with infant cognitive ability.	It is believed that genetic factors play a large role in the development of many cognitive and neurological processes; however, epidemiological evidence for the genetic basis of childhood neurodevelopment is very limited. Identification of the genetic polymorphisms associated with early-stage neurodevelopment will help elucidate biological mechanisms involved in neuro-behavior and provide a better understanding of the developing brain. To search for such variants, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for infant mental and motor ability at two years of age with mothers and children recruited from cohorts in Bangladesh and Mexico. Infant ability was assessed using mental and motor composite scores calculated with country-specific versions of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. A missense variant (rs1055153) located in the gene WWTR1 reached genome-wide significance in association with mental composite score (meta-analysis effect size of minor allele β(meta) = -6.04; 95% CI: -8.13 to -3.94; P = 1.56×10(-8)). Infants carrying the minor allele reported substantially lower cognitive scores in both cohorts, and this variant is predicted to be in the top 0.3% of most deleterious substitutions in the human genome. Fine mapping and region-based association testing provided additional suggestive evidence that both WWTR1 and a second gene, LRP1B, were associated with infant cognitive ability. Comparisons with recently conducted GWAS in intelligence and educational attainment indicate that our phenotypes do not possess a high genetic correlation with either adolescent or adult cognitive traits, suggesting that infant neurological assessments should be treated as an independent outcome of interest. Additional functional studies and replication efforts in other cohorts may help uncover new biological pathways and genetic architectures that are crucial to the developing brain.	
30130595	Pilot genome-wide association study identifying novel risk loci for type 2 diabetes in a Maya population.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is one of the two leading causes of mortality in Mexico. However, most studies have focused on Caucasians or Asians, and there are a small number of studies investigating Maya populations. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no information on isolated Maya communities with T2D frequencies of 20% that are primarily attributed to ethnicity. Consequently, this study focused on assessing which genetic risk variants could be involved in the high rates of T2D in 92 individuals with Maya ancestry; 47 were diagnosed with T2D, and 45 were classified as healthy individuals. A pilot genome-wide association study was performed using the Affymetrix Axiom Genome-wide LAT1 array. The population structure was determined with the ADMIXTURE software using 1289 Latin American selected polymorphisms, and 39 polymorphisms associated with T2D were included for replication. Association tests were performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) using the allelic, genotype and Armitage trend tests. The results indicated that population structure analysis displayed no differences between T2D patients and healthy individuals; 24 loci located were identified for probable association with T2D (p > 1.288 × 10(-7) and p < 1.348 × 10(-4)); the polymorphism AGTR2 rs1914711 in chromosome X was identified by the allele test (OR = 6.824; p = 1.448 × 10(-9)) as a candidate gene for association with T2D; and ARL15 rs4311394 was associated as a T2D protector by genotype and the Armitage trend test (OR = 0.318; p = 0.001). In conclusion, this study proposes 24 candidate SNPs associated with T2D for replication studies and one for protective association with T2D.	
30134952	Cross-genetic determination of maternal and neonatal immune mediators during pregnancy.	The immune system plays a fundamental role in development during pregnancy and early life. Alterations in circulating maternal and neonatal immune mediators have been associated with pregnancy complications as well as susceptibility to autoimmune and neurodevelopmental conditions in later life. Evidence suggests that the immune system in adults not only responds to environmental stimulation but is also under strong genetic control. This is the first genetic study of > 700 mother-infant pairs to analyse the circulating levels of 22 maternal mid-gestational serum-derived and 42 neonatal bloodspot-derived immune mediators (cytokines/chemokines) in the context of maternal and fetal genotype. We first estimated the maternal and fetal genome-wide SNP-based heritability (h(2)(g)) for each immune molecule and then performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify specific loci contributing to individual immune mediators. Finally, we assessed the relationship between genetic immune determinants and ASD outcome. We show maternal and neonatal cytokines/chemokines displaying genetic regulation using independent methodologies. We demonstrate that novel fetal loci for immune function independently affect the physiological levels of maternal immune mediators and vice versa. The cross-associated loci are in distinct genomic regions compared with individual-specific immune mediator loci. Finally, we observed an interaction between increased IL-8 levels at birth, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) status, and a specific maternal genotype. Our results suggest that maternal and fetal genetic variation influences the immune system during pregnancy and at birth via distinct mechanisms and that a better understanding of immune factor determinants in early development may shed light on risk factors for developmental disorders.	
30294719	Sex Differences in Genetic Associations With Longevity.	Sex differences in genetic associations with human longevity remain largely unknown; investigations on this topic are important for individualized health care. To explore sex differences in genetic associations with longevity. This population-based case-control study used sex-specific genome-wide association study and polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to examine sex differences in genetic associations with longevity. Five hundred sixty-four male and 1614 female participants older than 100 years were compared with a control group of 773 male and 1526 female individuals aged 40 to 64 years. All were Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study participants with Han ethnicity who were recruited in 1998 and 2008 to 2014. Sex-specific loci and pathways associated with longevity and PRS measures of joint effects of sex-specific loci. Eleven male-specific and 11 female-specific longevity loci ((P) < 10(-5)) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific longevity loci (10(-5) ≤(P) < 10(-4)) were identified. Each of these loci's associations with longevity were replicated in north and south regions of China in one sex but were not significant in the other sex ((P) = .13-.97), and loci-sex interaction effects were significant ((P) < .05). The associations of loci rs60210535 of the(LINC00871) gene with longevity were replicated in Chinese women ((P) = 9.0 × 10(-5)) and US women ((P) = 4.6 × 10(-5)) but not significant in Chinese and US men. The associations of the loci rs2622624 of the(ABCG2) gene were replicated in Chinese women ((P) = 6.8 × 10(-5)) and European women ((P) = .003) but not significant in both Chinese and European men. Eleven male-specific pathways (inflammation and immunity genes) and 34 female-specific pathways (tryptophan metabolism and PGC-1α induced) were significantly associated with longevity ((P) < .005; false discovery rate < 0.05). The PRS analyses demonstrated that sex-specific associations with longevity of the 4 exclusive groups of 11 male-specific and 11 female-specific loci ((P) < 10(-5)) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific loci (10(-5) ≤(P) < 10(-4)) were jointly replicated across north and south discovery and target samples. Analyses using the combined data set of north and south showed that these 4 groups of sex-specific loci were jointly and significantly associated with longevity in one sex ((P) = 2.9 × 10(-70) to 1.3 × 10(-39)) but not jointly significant in the other sex ((P) = .11 to .70), while interaction effects between PRS and sex were significant ((P) = 4.8 × 10(-50) to 1.2 × 10(-16)). The sex differences in genetic associations with longevity are remarkable, but have been overlooked by previously published genome-wide association studies on longevity. This study contributes to filling this research gap and provides a scientific basis for further investigating effects of sex-specific genetic variants and their interactions with environment on healthy aging, which may substantially contribute to more effective and targeted individualized health care for male and female elderly individuals.	
30152087	Age-specific genome-wide association study in glioblastoma identifies increased proportion of 'lower grade glioma'-like features associated with younger age.	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in the United States. Incidence of GBM increases with age, and younger age-at-diagnosis is significantly associated with improved prognosis. While the relationship between candidate GBM risk SNPs and age-at-diagnosis has been explored, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not previously been stratified by age. Potential age-specific genetic effects were assessed in autosomal SNPs for GBM patients using data from four previous GWAS. Using age distribution tertiles (18-53, 54-64, 65+) datasets were analyzed using age-stratified logistic regression to generate p values, odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), and then combined using meta-analysis. There were 4,512 total GBM cases, and 10,582 controls used for analysis. Significant associations were detected at two previously identified SNPs in 7p11.2 (rs723527 [p(54-63) = 1.50x10(-9) , OR(54-63) = 1.28, 95%CI(54-63) = 1.18-1.39; p(64+) = 2.14x10(-11) , OR(64+) = 1.32, 95%CI(64+) = 1.21-1.43] and rs11979158 [p(54-63) = 6.13x10(-8) , OR(54-63) = 1.35, 95%CI(54-63) = 1.21-1.50; p(64+) = 2.18x10(-10) , OR(64+) = 1.42, 95%CI(64+) = 1.27-1.58]) but only in persons >54. There was also a significant association at the previously identified lower grade glioma (LGG) risk locus at 8q24.21 (rs55705857) in persons ages 18-53 (p(18-53) = 9.30 × 10(-11) , OR(18-53) = 1.76, 95%CI(18-53) = 1.49-2.10). Within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) there was higher prevalence of 'LGG'-like tumor characteristics in GBM samples in those 18-53, with IDH1/2 mutation frequency of 15%, as compared to 2.1% [54-63] and 0.8% [64+] (p = 0.0005). Age-specific differences in cancer susceptibility can provide important clues to etiology. The association of a SNP known to confer risk for IDH1/2 mutant glioma and higher prevalence of IDH1/2 mutation within younger individuals 18-53 suggests that more younger individuals may present initially with 'secondary glioblastoma.'	
30150663	GWAS of lifetime cannabis use reveals new risk loci, genetic overlap with psychiatric traits, and a causal influence of schizophrenia.	Cannabis use is a heritable trait that has been associated with adverse mental health outcomes. In the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for lifetime cannabis use to date (N = 184,765), we identified eight genome-wide significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms in six regions. All measured genetic variants combined explained 11% of the variance. Gene-based tests revealed 35 significant genes in 16 regions, and S-PrediXcan analyses showed that 21 genes had different expression levels for cannabis users versus nonusers. The strongest finding across the different analyses was CADM2, which has been associated with substance use and risk-taking. Significant genetic correlations were found with 14 of 25 tested substance use and mental health-related traits, including smoking, alcohol use, schizophrenia and risk-taking. Mendelian randomization analysis showed evidence for a causal positive influence of schizophrenia risk on cannabis use. Overall, our study provides new insights into the etiology of cannabis use and its relation with mental health.	
30153862	Genome-wide association study for variants that modulate relationships between cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 42, tau, and p-tau levels.	A relationship quantitative trait locus exists when the correlation between multiple traits varies by genotype for that locus. Relationship quantitative trait loci (rQTL) are often involved in gene-by-gene (G×G) interactions or gene-by-environmental interactions, making them a powerful tool for detecting G×G. We performed genome-wide association studies to identify rQTL between tau and Aβ42 and ptau and Aβ42 with over 3000 individuals using age, gender, series, APOE ε2, APOE ε4, and two principal components for population structure as covariates. Each significant rQTL was separately screened for interactions with other loci for each trait in the rQTL model. Parametric bootstrapping was used to assess significance. We found four significant tau/Aβ42 rQTL from three unique locations and six ptau/Aβ42 rQTL from five unique locations. G×G screens with these rQTL produced four significant G×G interactions (one Aβ42, two ptau, and one tau) with four rQTL where each second locus was from a unique location. On follow-up, rs1036819 and rs74025622 were associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) case/control status; rs15205 and rs79099429 were associated with rate of decline. The two most significant rQTL (rs8027714 and rs1036819) for ptau/Aβ42 are on different chromosomes and both are strong hits for pelvic organ prolapse. While diseases of the nervous system can cause pelvic organ prolapse, it is unlikely related to the ptau/Aβ42 relationship but may suggest that these two loci share a pathway. In addition to a ptau/Aβ42 rQTL and association with AD case/control status, rs1036819 is a strong rQTL for case/control status/Aβ42 and for tau/Aβ42. It resides in the ZFAT gene, which is related to autoimmune thyroid disease. For tau, rs9817620 interacts with the tau/Aβ42 rQTL rs74025622. It is in the CHL1 gene, which is a neural cell adhesion molecule and may be involved in signal transduction pathways. CHL1 is related to BACE1, which is a β-secretase enzyme that initiates production of the β-amyloid peptide involved in AD and is a primary drug target. Overall, there are numerous loci that affect the relationship between these important AD endophenotypes and some are due to interactions with other loci. Some affect the risk of AD and/or rate of progression.	
30169657	A comprehensive evaluation of the genetic architecture of sudden cardiac arrest.	Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 10% of adult mortality in Western populations. We aim to identify potential loci associated with SCA and to identify risk factors causally associated with SCA. We carried out a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) for SCA (n = 3939 cases, 25 989 non-cases) to examine common variation genome-wide and in candidate arrhythmia genes. We also exploited Mendelian randomization (MR) methods using cross-trait multi-variant genetic risk score associations (GRSA) to assess causal relationships of 18 risk factors with SCA. No variants were associated with SCA at genome-wide significance, nor were common variants in candidate arrhythmia genes associated with SCA at nominal significance. Using cross-trait GRSA, we established genetic correlation between SCA and (i) coronary artery disease (CAD) and traditional CAD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes), (ii) height and BMI, and (iii) electrical instability traits (QT and atrial fibrillation), suggesting aetiologic roles for these traits in SCA risk. Our findings show that a comprehensive approach to the genetic architecture of SCA can shed light on the determinants of a complex life-threatening condition with multiple influencing factors in the general population. The results of this genetic analysis, both positive and negative findings, have implications for evaluating the genetic architecture of patients with a family history of SCA, and for efforts to prevent SCA in high-risk populations and the general community.	
30158200	Assessment of the genetic and clinical determinants of fracture risk: genome wide association and mendelian randomisation study.	To identify the genetic determinants of fracture risk and assess the role of 15 clinical risk factors on osteoporotic fracture risk. Meta-analysis of genome wide association studies (GWAS) and a two-sample mendelian randomisation approach. 25 cohorts from Europe, United States, east Asia, and Australia with genome wide genotyping and fracture data. A discovery set of 37 857 fracture cases and 227 116 controls; with replication in up to 147 200 fracture cases and 150 085 controls. Fracture cases were defined as individuals (>18 years old) who had fractures at any skeletal site confirmed by medical, radiological, or questionnaire reports. Instrumental variable analyses were performed to estimate effects of 15 selected clinical risk factors for fracture in a two-sample mendelian randomisation framework, using the largest previously published GWAS meta-analysis of each risk factor. Of 15 fracture associated loci identified, all were also associated with bone mineral density and mapped to genes clustering in pathways known to be critical to bone biology (eg,(SOST),(WNT16), and(ESR1)) or novel pathways ((FAM210A),(GRB10), and(ETS2)). Mendelian randomisation analyses showed a clear effect of bone mineral density on fracture risk. One standard deviation decrease in genetically determined bone mineral density of the femoral neck was associated with a 55% increase in fracture risk (odds ratio 1.55 (95% confidence interval 1.48 to 1.63; P=1.5×10(-68)). Hand grip strength was inversely associated with fracture risk, but this result was not significant after multiple testing correction. The remaining clinical risk factors (including vitamin D levels) showed no evidence for an effect on fracture. This large scale GWAS meta-analysis for fracture identified 15 genetic determinants of fracture, all of which also influenced bone mineral density. Among the clinical risk factors for fracture assessed, only bone mineral density showed a major causal effect on fracture. Genetic predisposition to lower levels of vitamin D and estimated calcium intake from dairy sources were not associated with fracture risk.	
30166351	Multitrait genome association analysis identifies new susceptibility genes for human anthropometric variation in the GCAT cohort.	Heritability estimates have revealed an important contribution of SNP variants for most common traits; however, SNP analysis by single-trait genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has failed to uncover their impact. In this study, we applied a multitrait GWAS approach to discover additional factor of the missing heritability of human anthropometric variation. We analysed 205 traits, including diseases identified at baseline in the GCAT cohort (Genomes For Life- Cohort study of the Genomes of Catalonia) (n=4988), a Mediterranean adult population-based cohort study from the south of Europe. We estimated SNP heritability contribution and single-trait GWAS for all traits from 15 million SNP variants. Then, we applied a multitrait-related approach to study genome-wide association to anthropometric measures in a two-stage meta-analysis with the UK Biobank cohort (n=336 107). Heritability estimates (eg, skin colour, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, body mass index, educational level or height) revealed an important contribution of SNP variants, ranging from 18% to 77%. Single-trait analysis identified 1785 SNPs with genome-wide significance threshold. From these, several previously reported single-trait hits were confirmed in our sample with(LINC01432) (p=1.9×10(-9)) variants associated with male baldness,(LDLR) variants with hyperlipidaemia (ICD-9:272) (p=9.4×10(-10)) and variants in(IRF4) (p=2.8×10(-57))(, SLC45A2) (p=2.2×10(-130))(, HERC2) (p=2.8×10(-176))(, OCA2) (p=2.4×10(-121)) and(MC1R) (p=7.7×10(-22)) associated with hair, eye and skin colour, freckling, tanning capacity and sun burning sensitivity and the Fitzpatrick phototype score, all highly correlated cross-phenotypes. Multitrait meta-analysis of anthropometric variation validated 27 loci in a two-stage meta-analysis with a large British ancestry cohort, six of which are newly reported here (p value threshold <5×10(-9)) at(ZRANB2-AS2),(PIK3R1),(EPHA7),(MAD1L1),(CACUL1) and(MAP3K9). Considering multiple-related genetic phenotypes improve associated genome signal detection. These results indicate the potential value of data-driven multivariate phenotyping for genetic studies in large population-based cohorts to contribute to knowledge of complex traits.	
30172743	Assessing the genetic correlations between early growth parameters and bone mineral density: A polygenic risk score analysis.	The relationships between early growth parameters and bone mineral density (BMD) remain elusive now. In this study, we performed a large scale polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis to evaluate the potential impact of early growth parameters on the variations of BMD. We used 2286 Caucasian subjects as cohort 1 and 3404 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) subjects as cohort 2 in this study. BMD at ulna & radius, hip and spine were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. BMD values were adjusted for age, sex, height and weight as covariates. Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of the 2286 Caucasian subjects was performed using Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0. The GWAS datasets of early growth parameters were driven from the Early Growth Genetics Consortium, including birth weight (BW), birth head circumference (BHC), childhood body mass index (CBMI), pubertal height growth related indexes and tanner stage. Polygenic Risk Score (PRSice) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression analysis were conducted to assess the genetic correlation between early growth parameters and BMD. We detected significant genetic correlations in cohort 1, such as total spine BMD vs. CBMI (p value = 1.51 × 10(-4), rg = 0.4525), right ulna and radius BMD vs. CBMI (p value = 1.51 × 10(-4), rg = 0.4399) and total body BMD vs. tanner stage (p value = 7.00 × 10(-4), rg = -0.0721). For cohort 2, significant correlations were observed for total spine BMD vs. height change standard deviation score (SDS) between 8 years and adult (denoted as PGF + PGM) (p value = 3.97 × 10(-4), rg = -0.1425), femoral neck BMD vs. the timing of peak height velocity by looking at the height change SDS between age 14 years and adult (denoted as PTF + PTM) (p value = 7.04 × 10(-4), rg = -0.2185), and total spine BMD vs. PTF + PTM (p value = 6.86 × 10(-4), rg = -0.2180). Our study results suggest that some early growth parameters could affect the variations of BMD.	
30161160	A genome-wide association study identifies three novel genetic markers for response to tamoxifen: A prospective multicenter study.	Although association studies of genetic variations with the clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen have been reported, genetic factors which could determine individual response to tamoxifen are not fully clarified. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify novel genetic markers for response to tamoxifen. We prospectively collected 347 blood samples from patients with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, invasive breast cancer receiving preoperative tamoxifen monotherapy for 14 to 28 days. We used Ki-67 response in breast cancer tissues after preoperative short-term tamoxifen therapy as a surrogate marker for response to tamoxifen. We performed GWAS and genotype imputation using 275 patients, and an independent set of 72 patients was used for replication study. The combined result of GWAS and the replication study, and subsequent imputation analysis indicated possible association of three loci with Ki-67 response after tamoxifen therapy (rs17198973 on chromosome 4q34.3, rs4577773 on 6q12, and rs7087428 on 10p13, Pcombined = 5.69 x 10-6, 1.64 x 10-5, and 9.77 x 10-6, respectively). When patients were classified into three groups by the scoring system based on the genotypes of the three SNPs, patients with higher scores showed significantly higher after/before ratio of Ki-67 compared to those with lower scores (P = 1.8 x 10-12), suggesting the cumulative effect of the three SNPs. We identified three novel loci, which could be associated with clinical response to tamoxifen. These findings provide new insights into personalized hormonal therapy for the patients with breast cancer.	
30160337	Genomewide association study reveals novel genetic loci associated with change in renal function in heart transplant recipients.	Renal dysfunction occurs commonly after heart transplantation (HTx) with wide inter-individual variability but whether a genetic predisposition exists in these patients is unknown. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have not been performed to assess the association of genetic variation with change in renal function after HTx. Clinical and demographic data of patients who underwent HTx and provided blood samples and consent for genetic analysis were included. Genotyping was performed using Illumina Infinium Human CoreExome v1.0 analysis kit. A GWAS utilizing linear regression models was performed with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1 year as the phenotype after adjusting for baseline eGFR prior to HTx and conversion from calcineurin inhibitor to sirolimus as primary immunosuppression therapy. A total of 251 HTx recipients were genotyped for 314,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The mean (SD) age was 50 (12.5) years; most patients were of European origin (n = 243, 96.8%) and males (n = 179, 71.3%). After adjustment for potential confounders, two variants, rs17033285 (P = 4.3 × 10(-7) ) and rs4917601 (P = 6.46 × 10(-7) ), in a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene LINC01121 and a pseudogene BTBD7P2, were identified to have a significant association with change in GFR at 1 year after HTx. Our first of its kind GWAS demonstrates that genetic variation affects renal function after HTx independent of other risk factors. Agnostic genetic approaches such as these may lead to identification of novel biological pathways such as the role of lncRNAs in the development of renal dysfunction post-HTx.	
30169916	Investigation of the predisposing factor of pemphigus and its clinical subtype through a genome-wide association and next generation sequence analysis.	Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and foliaceus (PF) as the two major histological subtypes. Associations with HLA molecules have been suggested, but specific HLA risk variants as well as non-HLA risk variants remain to be discovered. We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study in the Chinese Han population through a genome-wide discovery analysis and follow-up validation analysis in a total number of 210 PV, 159 PF and 2493 healthy controls. HLA imputation as well as high coverage next generation sequencing based HLA genotyping was employed to investigate the association of classical HLA alleles and amino acid change. We have discovered independent novel associations with PF at rs2178077 on 12q24.33, located next to RAN (P(PF) = 1.57 × 10(-9) ) and rs3888722 within the MHC region (P = 6.73 × 10(-9) ). For the HLA variants, we confirmed independent genome-wide level risk associations in HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1, with DQB1*05:03 to be the strongest association with PV (P = 8.59 × 10(-68) , OR = 31.16) and PF (P = 4.84 × 10(-17) , OR = 5.64). In addition, DRB1*14 was demonstrated to be a second independent variants (P = 4.2 × 10(-63) , OR = 35.47) for PV, while DRB1*04:06 was demonstrated to be the second independent signal (P = 7.44 × 10(-13) , OR = 5.58) for PF. These findings advance our understanding of the genetic basis of pemphigus susceptibility and may offer opportunities for risk prediction and preventive treatment for pemphigus, in particular for PV.	
30166627	Genome-wide association study of response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitor therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by chronic synovial joint inflammation. Treatment has been revolutionised by tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFi) but each available drug shows a significant non-response rate. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 1752 UK RA TNFi-treated patients to identify predictors of change in the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) and subcomponents over 3-6 months. The rs7195994 variant at the FTO gene locus was associated with infliximab response when looking at a change in the swollen joint count (SJC28) subcomponent (p = 9.74 × 10(-9)). Capture Hi-C data show chromatin interactions in GM12878 cells between rs2540767, in high linkage disequilibrium with rs7195994 (R(2) = 0.9) and IRX3, a neighbouring gene of FTO. IRX3 encodes a transcription factor involved in adipocyte remodelling and is regarded as the obesity gene at the FTO locus. Importantly, the rs7195994 association remained significantly associated following adjustment for BMI. In addition, using capture Hi-C data we showed interactions between TNFi-response associated variants and 16 RA susceptibility variants.	
30196971	Transethnic and race-stratified genome-wide association study of fibroid characteristics in African American and European American women.	To identify, through genome-wide association studies, genetic loci that associate with differences in fibroid size and number in a population of African American and European American women. Cross-sectional study. Not applicable. Using BioVU, a clinical population from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort, a prospective cohort, we identified 1520 women (609 African American and 911 European American) with documented fibroid characteristics. None. Outcome measurements include volume of largest fibroid, largest fibroid dimension, and number of fibroids (single vs. multiple). In race-stratified analyses we achieved genome-wide significance at a variant located between MAT2B and TENM2 (rs57542984, β = 0.13; 95% confidence interval 0.09, 0.17) for analyses of largest fibroid dimension in African Americans. The strongest signal for transethnic analyses was at a variant on 1q31.1 located between PLA2G4A and BRINP3 (rs6605005, β = 0.24; 95% confidence interval 0.15, 0.33) for fibroid volume. Results from MetaXcan identified an association between predicted expression of the gene ER degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase like protein 2 (EDEM2) in the thyroid and number of fibroids (Z score = -4.51). This study identified many novel associations between genetic loci and fibroid size and number in both race-stratified and transethnic analyses. Future studies are necessary to further validate our study findings and to better understand the mechanisms underlying these associations.	
30177863	Genome-wide association analyses identify 39 new susceptibility loci for diverticular disease.	Diverticular disease is common and has a high morbidity. Treatments are limited owing to the poor understanding of its pathophysiology. Here, to elucidate its etiology, we performed a genome-wide association study of diverticular disease (27,444 cases; 382,284 controls) from the UK Biobank and tested for replication in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (2,572 cases; 28,649 controls). We identified 42 loci associated with diverticular disease; 39 of these loci are novel. Using data-driven expression-prioritized integration for complex traits (DEPICT), we show that genes in these associated regions are significantly enriched for expression in mesenchymal stem cells and multiple connective tissue cell types and are co-expressed with genes that have a role in vascular and mesenchymal biology. Genes in these associated loci have roles in immunity, extracellular matrix biology, cell adhesion, membrane transport and intestinal motility. Phenome-wide association analysis of the 42 variants shows a common etiology of diverticular disease with obesity and hernia. These analyses shed light on the genomic landscape of diverticular disease.	
30181573	Genetics of serum urate concentrations and gout in a high-risk population, patients with chronic kidney disease.	We evaluated genetics of hyperuricemia and gout, their interaction with kidney function and medication intake in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of urate and gout were performed in 4941 CKD patients in the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study. Effect estimates of 26 known urate-associated population-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined. Interactions of urate-associated variants with urate-altering medications and clinical characteristics of gout were evaluated. Genome-wide significant associations with serum urate and gout were identified for known loci at SLC2A9 and ABCG2, but not for novel loci. Effects of the 26 known SNPs were of similar magnitude in CKD patients compared to population-based individuals, except for SNPs at ABCG2 that showed greater effects in CKD. Gene-medication interactions were not significant when accounting for multiple testing. Associations with gout in specific joints were significant for SLC2A9 rs12498742 in wrists and midfoot joints. Known genetic variants in SLC2A9 and ABCG2 were associated with urate and gout in a CKD cohort, with effect sizes for ABCG2 significantly greater in CKD compared to the general population. CKD patients are at high risk of gout due to reduced kidney function, diuretics intake and genetic predisposition, making treatment to target challenging.	
30178632	A genome-wide association study suggests new evidence for an association of the NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4) gene with severe diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes.	Diabetic retinopathy is the most common eye complication in patients with diabetes. The purpose of this study is to identify genetic factors contributing to severe diabetic retinopathy. A genome-wide association approach was applied. In the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS) datasets, cases of severe diabetic retinopathy were defined as type 2 diabetic patients who were ever graded as having severe background retinopathy (Level R3) or proliferative retinopathy (Level R4) in at least one eye according to the Scottish Diabetic Retinopathy Grading Scheme or who were once treated by laser photocoagulation. Controls were diabetic individuals whose longitudinal retinopathy screening records were either normal (Level R0) or only with mild background retinopathy (Level R1) in both eyes. Significant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were taken forward for meta-analysis using multiple Caucasian cohorts. Five hundred and sixty cases of type 2 diabetes with severe diabetic retinopathy and 4,106 controls were identified in the GoDARTS cohort. We revealed that rs3913535 in the NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4) gene reached a p value of 4.05 × 10(-9) . Two nearby SNPs, rs10765219 and rs11018670 also showed promising p values (p values = 7.41 × 10(-8) and 1.23 × 10(-8) , respectively). In the meta-analysis using multiple Caucasian cohorts (excluding GoDARTS), rs10765219 and rs11018670 showed associations for diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively), while the p value of rs3913535 was not significant (p = 0.429). This genome-wide association study of severe diabetic retinopathy suggests new evidence for the involvement of the NOX4 gene.	
30181555	Genetics of self-reported risk-taking behaviour, trans-ethnic consistency and relevance to brain gene expression.	Risk-taking behaviour is an important component of several psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Previously, two genetic loci have been associated with self-reported risk taking and significant genetic overlap with psychiatric disorders was identified within a subsample of UK Biobank. Using the white British participants of the full UK Biobank cohort (n = 83,677 risk takers versus 244,662 controls) for our primary analysis, we conducted a genome-wide association study of self-reported risk-taking behaviour. In secondary analyses, we assessed sex-specific effects, trans-ethnic heterogeneity and genetic overlap with psychiatric traits. We also investigated the impact of risk-taking-associated SNPs on both gene expression and structural brain imaging. We identified 10 independent loci for risk-taking behaviour, of which eight were novel and two replicated previous findings. In addition, we found two further sex-specific risk-taking loci. There were strong positive genetic correlations between risk-taking and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Index genetic variants demonstrated effects generally consistent with the discovery analysis in individuals of non-British White, South Asian, African-Caribbean or mixed ethnicity. Polygenic risk scores comprising alleles associated with increased risk taking were associated with lower white matter integrity. Genotype-specific expression pattern analyses highlighted DPYSL5, CGREF1 and C15orf59 as plausible candidate genes. Overall, our findings substantially advance our understanding of the biology of risk-taking behaviour, including the possibility of sex-specific contributions, and reveal consistency across ethnicities. We further highlight several putative novel candidate genes, which may mediate these genetic effects.	
30185882	Genetic Determinants of Telomere Length in African American Youth.	Telomere length (TL) is associated with numerous disease states and is affected by genetic and environmental factors. However, TL has been mostly studied in adult populations of European or Asian ancestry. These studies have identified 34 TL-associated genetic variants recently used as genetic proxies for TL. The generalizability of these associations to pediatric populations and racially diverse populations, specifically of African ancestry, remains unclear. Furthermore, six novel variants associated with TL in a population of European children have been identified but not validated. We measured TL from whole blood samples of 492 healthy African American youth (children and adolescents between 8 and 20 years old) and performed the first genome-wide association study of TL in this population. We were unable to replicate neither the 34 reported genetic associations found in adults nor the six genetic associations found in European children. However, we discovered a novel genome-wide significant association between TL and rs1483898 on chromosome 14. Our results underscore the importance of examining genetic associations with TL in diverse pediatric populations such as African Americans.	
30188897	Detecting past and ongoing natural selection among ethnically Tibetan women at high altitude in Nepal.	Adaptive evolution in humans has rarely been characterized for its whole set of components, i.e. selective pressure, adaptive phenotype, beneficial alleles and realized fitness differential. We combined approaches for detecting polygenic adaptations and for mapping the genetic bases of physiological and fertility phenotypes in approximately 1000 indigenous ethnically Tibetan women from Nepal, adapted to high altitude. The results of genome-wide association analyses and tests for polygenic adaptations showed evidence of positive selection for alleles associated with more pregnancies and live births and evidence of negative selection for those associated with higher offspring mortality. Lower hemoglobin level did not show clear evidence for polygenic adaptation, despite its strong association with an EPAS1 haplotype carrying selective sweep signals.	
30220432	Genetic Association of Albuminuria with Cardiometabolic Disease and Blood Pressure.	Excretion of albumin in urine, or albuminuria, is associated with the development of multiple cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, whether pathways leading to albuminuria are causal for cardiometabolic diseases is unclear. We addressed this question using a Mendelian randomization framework in the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort. We first performed a genome-wide association study for albuminuria in 382,500 individuals and identified 32 new albuminuria loci. We constructed albuminuria genetic risk scores and tested for association with cardiometabolic diseases. Genetically elevated albuminuria was strongly associated with increased risk of hypertension (1.38 OR; 95% CI, 1.27-1.50 per 1 SD predicted increase in albuminuria, p = 7.01 × 10(-14)). We then examined bidirectional associations of albuminuria with blood pressure which suggested that genetically elevated albuminuria led to higher blood pressure (2.16 mmHg systolic blood pressure; 95% CI, 1.51-2.82 per 1 SD predicted increase in albuminuria, p = 1.22 × 10(-10)) and that genetically elevated blood pressure led to more albuminuria (0.005 SD; 95% CI 0.004-0.006 per 1 mmHg predicted increase in systolic blood pressure, p = 2.45 × 10(-13)). These results support the existence of a feed-forward loop between albuminuria and blood pressure and imply that albuminuria could increase risk of cardiovascular disease through blood pressure. Moreover, they suggest therapies that target albuminuria-increasing processes could have antihypertensive effects that are amplified through inhibition of this feed-forward loop.	
30202859	Large-scale meta-analysis highlights the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in the genetic regulation of menstrual cycle length.	The normal menstrual cycle requires a delicate interplay between the hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary. Therefore, its length is an important indicator of female reproductive health. Menstrual cycle length has been shown to be partially controlled by genetic factors, especially in the follicle-stimulating hormone beta-subunit (FSHB) locus. A genome-wide association study meta-analysis of menstrual cycle length in 44 871 women of European ancestry confirmed the previously observed association with the FSHB locus and identified four additional novel signals in, or near, the GNRH1, PGR, NR5A2 and INS-IGF2 genes. These findings not only confirm the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in the genetic regulation of menstrual cycle length but also highlight potential novel local regulatory mechanisms, such as those mediated by IGF2.	
30194396	Variants associating with uterine leiomyoma highlight genetic background shared by various cancers and hormone-related traits.	Uterine leiomyomas are common benign tumors of the myometrium. We performed a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies of leiomyoma in European women (16,595 cases and 523,330 controls), uncovering 21 variants at 16 loci that associate with the disease. Five variants were previously reported to confer risk of various malignant or benign tumors (rs78378222 in TP53, rs10069690 in TERT, rs1800057 and rs1801516 in ATM, and rs7907606 at OBFC1) and four signals are located at established risk loci for hormone-related traits (endometriosis and breast cancer) at 1q36.12 (CDC42/WNT4), 2p25.1 (GREB1), 20p12.3 (MCM8), and 6q26.2 (SYNE1/ESR1). Polygenic score for leiomyoma, computed using UKB data, is significantly correlated with risk of cancer in the Icelandic population. Functional annotation suggests that the non-coding risk variants affect multiple genes, including ESR1. Our results provide insights into the genetic background of leiomyoma that are shared by other benign and malignant tumors and highlight the role of hormones in leiomyoma growth.	
30194254	Genome-wide association study implicates immune dysfunction in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma.	To further our understanding of inherited susceptibility to Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), we performed a meta-analysis of 7 genome-wide association studies totaling 5325 HL cases and 22 423 control patients. We identify 5 new HL risk loci at 6p21.31 (rs649775;(P) = 2.11 × 10(-10)), 6q23.3 (rs1002658;(P) = 2.97 × 10(-8)), 11q23.1 (rs7111520;(P) = 1.44 × 10(-11)), 16p11.2 (rs6565176;(P) = 4.00 × 10(-8)), and 20q13.12 (rs2425752;(P) = 2.01 × 10(-8)). Integration of gene expression, histone modification, and in situ promoter capture Hi-C data at the 5 new and 13 known risk loci implicates dysfunction of the germinal center reaction, disrupted T-cell differentiation and function, and constitutive NF-κB activation as mechanisms of predisposition. These data provide further insights into the genetic susceptibility and biology of HL.	
30219690	GWAS and systems biology analysis of depressive symptoms among smokers from the COPDGene cohort.	Large sample GWAS is needed to identify genetic factors associated with depression. This study used genome-wide genotypic and phenotypic data from the COPDGene study to identify genetic risk factors for depression. Data were from 9716 COPDGene subjects with ≥10 pack-year history. Depression was defined as antidepressant use and/or a HADS depression subscale score ≥8. Non-Hispanic White (6576) and African-American (3140) subsets were analyzed. A GWAS pipeline identified SNPs associated with depression in each group. Network analysis software analyzed gene interactions through common biological pathways, genetic interactions, and tissue-specific gene expression. The mean age was 59.4 years (SD 9.0) with 46.5% female subjects. Depression was in 24.7% of the NHW group (1622) and 12.5% of the AA group (391). No SNPs had genome-wide significance. One of the top SNPs, rs12036147 (p = 1.28 × 10(-6)), is near CHRM3. Another SNP was near MDGA2 (rs17118176, p = 3.52 × 10(-6)). Top genes formed networks for synaptic transmission with a statistically significant level of more co-expression in brain than other tissues, particularly in the basal ganglia (p = 1.00 × 10(-4)). Limitations included a depression definition based on antidepressant use and a limited HADS score subgroup, which could increase false negatives in depressed patients not on antidepressants. Antidepressants used for smoking cessation in non-depressed patients could lead to false positives. Systems biology analysis identified statistically significant pathways whereby multiple genes influence depression. The gene set pathway analysis and COPDGene data can help investigate depression in future studies.	
30201983	NT5C2 germline variants alter thiopurine metabolism and are associated with acquired NT5C2 relapse mutations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.	The antileukaemic drug 6-mercaptopurine is converted into thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) and incorporated into DNA (DNA-TG), the active end metabolite. In a series of genome-wide association studies, we analysed time-weighted means ((wm)) of erythrocyte concentrations of TGN (Ery-TGN) and DNA-TG in 1009 patients undergoing maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In discovery analyses (454 patients), the propensity for DNA-TG incorporation ((wm)DNA-TG/(wm)Ery-TGN ratio) was significantly associated with three intronic SNPs in NT5C2 (top hit: rs72846714; P = 2.09 × 10(-10), minor allele frequency 15%). In validation analyses (555 patients), this association remained significant during both early and late maintenance therapy (P = 8.4 × 10(-6) and 1.3 × 10(-3), respectively). The association was mostly driven by differences in(wm)Ery-TGN, but in regression analyses adjusted for(wm)Ery-TGN (P < 0.0001), rs72846714-A genotype was also associated with a higher(wm)DNA-TG (P = 0.029). Targeted sequencing of NT5C2 did not identify any missense variants associated with rs72846714 or(wm)Ery-TGN/(wm)DNA-TG. rs72846714 was not associated with relapse risk, but in a separate cohort of 180 children with relapsed ALL, rs72846714-A genotype was associated with increased occurrence of relapse-specific NT5C2 gain-of-function mutations that reduce cytosol TGN levels (P = 0.03). These observations highlight the impact of both germline and acquired mutations in drug metabolism and disease trajectory.	
30206230	GWAS for Interleukin-1β levels in gingival crevicular fluid identifies IL37 variants in periodontal inflammation.	There is no agnostic GWAS evidence for the genetic control of IL-1β expression in periodontal disease. Here we report a GWAS for "high" gingival crevicular fluid IL-1β expression among 4910 European-American adults and identify association signals in the IL37 locus. rs3811046 at this locus (p = 3.3 × 10(-22)) is associated with severe chronic periodontitis (OR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.12-2.00), 10-year incident tooth loss (≥3 teeth: RR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.09-1.62) and aggressive periodontitis (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.01-1.26) in an independent sample of 4927 German/Dutch adults. The minor allele at rs3811046 is associated with increased expression of IL-1β in periodontal tissue. In RAW macrophages, PBMCs and transgenic mice, the IL37 variant increases expression of IL-1β and IL-6, inducing more severe periodontal disease, while IL-37 protein production is impaired and shows reduced cleavage by caspase-1. A second variant in the IL37 locus (rs2708943, p = 4.2 × 10(-7)) associates with attenuated IL37 mRNA expression. Overall, we demonstrate that IL37 variants modulate the inflammatory cascade in periodontal disease.	
30277614	Genome-wide interaction studies identify sex-specific risk alleles for nonsyndromic orofacial clefts.	Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is the most common craniofacial birth defect in humans and is notable for its apparent sexual dimorphism where approximately twice as many males are affected as females. The sources of this disparity are largely unknown, but interactions between genetic and sex effects are likely contributors. We examined gene-by-sex (G × S) interactions in a worldwide sample of 2,142 NSCL/P cases and 1,700 controls recruited from 13 countries. First, we performed genome-wide joint tests of the genetic (G) and G × S effects genome-wide using logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model and adjusting for 18 principal components of ancestry. We further interrogated loci with suggestive results from the joint test ( p < 1.00 × 10(-5) ) by examining the G × S effects from the same model. Out of the 133 loci with suggestive results ( p < 1.00 × 10(-5) ) for the joint test, we observed one genome-wide significant G × S effect in the 10q21 locus (rs72804706; p = 6.69 × 10(-9) ; OR = 2.62 CI [1.89, 3.62]) and 16 suggestive G × S effects. At the intergenic 10q21 locus, the risk of NSCL/P is estimated to increase with additional copies of the minor allele for females, but the opposite effect for males. Our observation that the impact of genetic variants on NSCL/P risk differs for males and females may further our understanding of the genetic architecture of NSCL/P and the sex differences underlying clefts and other birth defects.	
30213928	Identification of multiple risk loci and regulatory mechanisms influencing susceptibility to multiple myeloma.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have transformed our understanding of susceptibility to multiple myeloma (MM), but much of the heritability remains unexplained. We report a new GWAS, a meta-analysis with previous GWAS and a replication series, totalling 9974 MM cases and 247,556 controls of European ancestry. Collectively, these data provide evidence for six new MM risk loci, bringing the total number to 23. Integration of information from gene expression, epigenetic profiling and in situ Hi-C data for the 23 risk loci implicate disruption of developmental transcriptional regulators as a basis of MM susceptibility, compatible with altered B-cell differentiation as a key mechanism. Dysregulation of autophagy/apoptosis and cell cycle signalling feature as recurrently perturbed pathways. Our findings provide further insight into the biological basis of MM.	
30277654	Gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase genetic polymorphism is a candidate locus for responsiveness to opioid analgesics in patients with cancer pain: An exploratory study.	Cancer pain impairs not only physical functions but also social functions and roles. Consequently, the overall health-related quality of life of patients with cancer pain deteriorates. Opioid analgesics are recommended for treating moderate to strong cancer pain. Advances in human genome research have fueled a growing interest to understand individual differences in responsiveness to opioid analgesics. This study aimed to explore and identify novel loci for genes predisposing an individual to opioid analgesic responsiveness. A total of 71 cancer patients rated their pain on an 11-point numerical rating scale twice before and after increasing opioid analgesics. A genomewide association study focusing on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted to associate pain decrease with increased dosage of opioid analgesics based on weight (ie, responsiveness to opioid analgesics). A genomewide significance (P < 5E-8) was set for multiplicity of analyses to control for false positives. Two SNPs passed the genomewide threshold for significance. One exonic SNP (rs1641025) was located in the ABAT [4-aminobutyrate aminotransaminase (GABA transaminase)] gene on chromosome 16. The other SNP (rs12494691) was located on chromosome 3, which was not associated with any known genes. These SNPs were not associated with opioid-related adverse effects. Our results preliminarily suggest that both SNPs might be potential candidate loci for responsiveness to opioid analgesics, and GABA transaminase might be a possible target for developing adjuvant pharmacotherapy with opioid analgesics in adjuvant pharmacotherapy. Our results should be validated in a large-scale study with a larger sample size.	
30217807	Genetic Variants Associated with Circulating Fibroblast Growth Factor 23.	Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived hormone that regulates phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism, contributes to the pathogenesis of mineral and bone disorders in CKD and is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor. Central elements of FGF23 regulation remain incompletely understood; genetic variation may help explain interindividual differences. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of circulating FGF23 concentrations among 16,624 participants of European ancestry from seven cohort studies, excluding participants with eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) to focus on FGF23 under normal conditions. We evaluated the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with natural log-transformed FGF23 concentration, adjusted for age, sex, study site, and principal components of ancestry. A second model additionally adjusted for BMI and eGFR. We discovered 154 SNPs from five independent regions associated with FGF23 concentration. The SNP with the strongest association, rs17216707 ((P)=3.0×10(-24)), lies upstream of(CYP24A1), which encodes the primary catabolic enzyme for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Each additional copy of the T allele at this locus is associated with 5% higher FGF23 concentration. Another locus strongly associated with variations in FGF23 concentration is rs11741640, within(RGS14) and upstream of(SLC34A1) (a gene involved in renal phosphate transport). Additional adjustment for BMI and eGFR did not materially alter the magnitude of these associations. Another top locus (within(ABO), the ABO blood group transferase gene) was no longer statistically significant at the genome-wide level. Common genetic variants located near genes involved in vitamin D metabolism and renal phosphate transport are associated with differences in circulating FGF23 concentrations.	
30217971	Genome-wide association study of seasonal affective disorder.	Family and twin studies have shown a genetic component to seasonal affective disorder (SAD). A number of candidate gene studies have examined the role of variations within biologically relevant genes in SAD susceptibility, but few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to date. The authors aimed to identify genetic risk variants for SAD through GWAS. The authors performed a GWAS for SAD in 1380 cases and 2937 controls of European-American (EA) origin, selected from samples for GWAS of major depressive disorder and of bipolar disorder. Further bioinformatic analyses were conducted to examine additional genomic and biological evidence associated with the top GWAS signals. No susceptibility loci for SAD were identified at a genome-wide significant level. The strongest association was at an intronic variant (rs139459337) within ZBTB20 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.63, p = 8.4 × 10(-7)), which encodes a transcriptional repressor that has roles in neurogenesis and in adult brain. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis showed that the risk allele "T" of rs139459337 is associated with reduced mRNA expression of ZBTB20 in human temporal cortex (p = 0.028). Zbtb20 is required for normal murine circadian rhythm and for entrainment to a shortened day. Of the 330 human orthologs of murine genes directly repressed by Zbtb20, there were 32 associated with SAD in our sample (at p < 0.05), representing a significant enrichment of ZBTB20 targets among our SAD genetic association signals (fold = 1.93, p = 0.001). ZBTB20 is a candidate susceptibility gene for SAD, based on a convergence of genetic, genomic, and biological evidence. Further studies are necessary to confirm its role in SAD.	
30218097	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of aggressive and chronic periodontitis identifies two novel risk loci.	Periodontitis is one of the most common inflammatory diseases, with a prevalence of 11% worldwide for the severe forms and an estimated heritability of 50%. It is classified into the widespread moderate form chronic periodontitis (CP) and the rare early-onset and severe phenotype aggressive periodontitis (AgP). These different disease manifestations are thought to share risk alleles and predisposing environmental factors. To obtain novel insights into the shared genetic etiology and the underlying molecular mechanisms of both forms, we performed a two step-wise meta-analysis approach using genome-wide association studies of both phenotypes. Genotypes from imputed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AgP and CP comprising 5,095 cases and 9,908 controls of North-West European genetic background were included. Two loci were associated with periodontitis at a genome-wide significance level. They located within the pseudogene MTND1P5 on chromosome 8 (rs16870060-G, P = 3.69 × 10(-9), OR = 1.36, 95% CI = [1.23-1.51]) and intronic of the long intergenic non-coding RNA LOC107984137 on chromosome 16, downstream of the gene SHISA9 (rs729876-T, P = 9.77 × 10(-9), OR = 1.24, 95% CI = [1.15-1.34]). This study identified novel risk loci of periodontitis, adding to the genetic basis of AgP and CP.	
30224653	Genetic analysis of over 1 million people identifies 535 new loci associated with blood pressure traits.	High blood pressure is a highly heritable and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We report the largest genetic association study of blood pressure traits (systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure) to date in over 1 million people of European ancestry. We identify 535 novel blood pressure loci that not only offer new biological insights into blood pressure regulation but also highlight shared genetic architecture between blood pressure and lifestyle exposures. Our findings identify new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation with potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future.	
30263045	Heritability and genetic associations of triglyceride and HDL-C levels using pedigree-based and empirical kinships.	The heritability of a phenotype is an estimation of the percent of variance in that phenotype that is attributable to additive genetic factors. Heritability is optimally estimated in family-based sample populations. Traditionally, this involves use of a pedigree-based kinship coefficient generated from the collected genealogical relationships between family members. An alternative, when dense genotype data are available, is to directly measure the empirical kinship between samples. This study compares the use of pedigree and empirical kinships in the GAW20 data set. Two phenotypes were assessed: triglyceride levels and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels pre- and postintervention with the cholesterol-reducing drug fenofibrate. Using SOLAR (Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines), pedigree-based kinships and empirically calculated kinships (using IBDLD and LDAK) were used to calculate phenotype heritability. In addition, a genome-wide association study was conducted using each kinship model for each phenotype to identify genetic variants significantly associated with phenotypic variation. The variant rs247617 was significantly associated with HDL-C levels both pre- and post-fenofibrate intervention. Overall, the phenotype heritabilities calculated using pedigree based kinships or either of the empirical kinships generated using IBDLD or LDAK were comparable. Phenotype heritabilities estimated from empirical kinships generated using IBDLD were closest to the pedigree-based estimations. Given that there was not an appreciable amount of unknown relatedness between the pedigrees in this data set, a large increase in heritability in using empirical kinship was not expected, and our calculations support this. Importantly, these results demonstrate that when sufficient genotypic data are available, empirical kinship estimation is a practical alternative to using pedigree-based kinships.	
30255771	Investigation of parent-of-origin effects induced by fenofibrate treatment on triglycerides levels.	Genome-wide association studies performed on triglycerides (TGs) have not accounted for epigenetic mechanisms that may partially explain trait heritability. Parent-of-origin (POO) effect association analyses using an agnostic approach or a candidate approach were performed for pretreatment TG levels, posttreatment TG levels, and pre- and posttreatment TG-level differences in the real GAW20 family data set. We detected 22 genetic variants with suggestive POO effects with at least 1 phenotype (P ≤ 10(- 5)). We evaluated the association of these 22 significant genetic variants showing POO effects with close DNA methylation probes associated with TGs. A total of 18 DNA methylation probes located in the vicinity of the 22 SNPs were associated with at least 1 phenotype and 6 SNP-probe pairs were associated with DNA methylation probes at the nominal level of P < 0.05, among which 1 pair presented evidence of POO effect. Our analyses identified a paternal effect of SNP rs301621 on the difference between pre- and posttreatment TG levels (P = 1.2 × 10(- 5)). This same SNP showed evidence for a maternal effect on methylation levels of a nearby probe (cg10206250; P = 0.01). Using a causal inference test we established that the observed POO effect of rs301621 was not mediated by DNA methylation at cg10206250. We performed POO effect association analyses of SNPs with TGs, as well as association analyses of SNPs with DNA methylation probes. These analyses, which were followed by a causal inference test, established that the paternal effect at the SNP rs301621 is induced by treatment and is not mediated by methylation level at cg10206250.	
30263053	Genome-wide association study for multiple phenotype analysis.	Genome-wide association studies often collect multiple phenotypes for complex diseases. Multivariate joint analyses have higher power to detect genetic variants compared with the marginal analysis of each phenotype and are also able to identify loci with pleiotropic effects. We extend the unified score-based association test to incorporate family structure, apply different approaches to analyze multiple traits in GAW20 real samples, and compare the results. Through simulation studies, we confirm that the Type I error rate of the pedigree-based unified score association test is appropriately controlled. In marginalanalysis of triglyceride levels, we found 1 subgenome-wide significant variant on chromosome 6. Joint analyses identified several suggestive genome-wide significant signals, with the pedigree-based unified score association test yielding the greatest number of significant results.	
30275891	Family-based genome-wide association of inflammation biomarkers and fenofibrate treatment response in the GOLDN study.	In this paper we analyzed whole-genome genetic information provided by GAW20 from the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study for family data. Lipid levels such as triglycerides (TGs) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are measured at different time points before and after administration of an anti-inflammatory drug fenofibrate. Apart from that, the data contain some covariates and whole-genome genotype information. We propose 2 novel approaches based on Henderson's iterative mixed model to identify associated loci corresponding to (a) inflammatory biomarkers like TGs and HDLs together over time, and (b) the response to fenofibrate treatment. We developed a mixed-model approach using both TG and HDL phenotypes at all 4 time points for a genetic association study whereas we used TGs only to study genetic association with response to the drug. We expect that use of complete family data in a longitudinal framework under a single model involving the appropriate correlation structures would be able to exploit the maximum possible information contained in the sample. Our analysis of whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genomic regions corresponding to drug treatment finds no significant locus after multiple correction. Arguably, the moderately small sample size of the data set, as compared to the sample size usually used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), could be a reason for such a result. Nevertheless, we report the top 20 SNPs associated with the phenotypes, and the top 20 SNPs and genomic regions associated with a response to fenofibrate treatment. Application of our methods to larger GWAS and further functional validation of the reported top SNPs and genomic regions might provide important biological insight into the genetic constitution of the trait.	
30223776	Bivariate genome-wide association analysis strengthens the role of bitter receptor clusters on chromosomes 7 and 12 in human bitter taste.	Human perception of bitter substances is partially genetically determined. Previously we discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the cluster of bitter taste receptor genes on chromosome 12 that accounts for 5.8% of the variance in the perceived intensity rating of quinine, and we strengthened the classic association between TAS2R38 genotype and the bitterness of propylthiouracil (PROP). Here we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a 40% larger sample (n = 1999) together with a bivariate approach to detect previously unidentified common variants with small effects on bitter perception. We identified two signals, both with small effects (< 2%), within the bitter taste receptor clusters on chromosomes 7 and 12, which influence the perceived bitterness of denatonium benzoate and sucrose octaacetate respectively. We also provided the first independent replication for an association of caffeine bitterness on chromosome 12. Furthermore, we provided evidence for pleiotropic effects on quinine, caffeine, sucrose octaacetate and denatonium benzoate for the three SNPs on chromosome 12 and the functional importance of the SNPs for denatonium benzoate bitterness. These findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of bitter taste and offer a useful starting point for determining the biological pathways linking perception of bitter substances.	
30324795	Genetic determinants of glucose levels in pregnancy: genetic risk scores analysis and GWAS in the Norwegian STORK cohort.	Objective Hyperglycaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of adverse health outcomes in mother and child, but the genetic aetiology is scarcely studied. Our aims were to (1) assess the overlapping genetic aetiology between the pregnant and non-pregnant population and (2) assess the importance of genome-wide polygenic contributions to glucose traits during pregnancy, by exploring whether genetic risk scores (GRSs) for fasting glucose (FG), 2-h glucose (2hG), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and BMI in non-pregnant individuals were associated with glucose measures in pregnant women. Methods We genotyped 529 Norwegian pregnant women and constructed GRS from known genome-wide significant variants and SNPs weakly associated (p > 5 × 10-8) with FG, 2hG, BMI and T2D from external genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and examined the association between these scores and glucose measures at gestational weeks 14-16 and 30-32. We also performed GWAS of FG, 2hG and shape information from the glucose curve during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Results GRSFG explained similar variance during pregnancy as in the non-pregnant population (~5%). GRSBMI and GRST2D explained up to 1.3% of the variation in the glucose traits in pregnancy. If we included variants more weakly associated with these traits, GRS2hG and GRST2D explained up to 2.4% of the variation in the glucose traits in pregnancy, highlighting the importance of polygenic contributions. Conclusions Our results suggest overlap in the genetic aetiology of FG in pregnant and non-pregnant individuals. This was less apparent with 2hG, suggesting potential differences in postprandial glucose metabolism inside and outside of pregnancy.	
30228239	Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Genetic Link between Diarrhea-Associated Entamoeba histolytica Infection and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.	(Entamoeba histolytica) is the etiologic agent of amebic dysentery, though clinical manifestation of infection is highly variable ranging from subclinical colonization to invasive disease. We hypothesize that host genetics contribute to the variable outcomes of(E. histolytica) infection; thus, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two independent birth cohorts of Bangladeshi infants monitored for susceptibility to(E. histolytica) disease in the first year of life. Children with at least one diarrheal episode positive for(E. histolytica) (cases) were compared to children with no detectable(E. histolytica) infection in the same time frame (controls). Meta-analyses under a fixed-effect inverse variance weighting model identified multiple variants in a region of chromosome 10 containing loci associated with symptomatic(E. histolytica) infection. An intergenic insertion between(CREM) and(CCNY) (rs58000832) achieved genome-wide significance ((P) value from meta-analysis [(P)(meta)] = 6.05 × 10(-9)), and each additional risk allele of rs58000832 conferred 2.42 increased odds of a diarrhea-associated(E. histolytica) infection. The most strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within a gene was in an intron of(CREM) (rs58468612;(P)(meta) = 8.94 × 10(-8)), which has been implicated as a susceptibility locus for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Gene expression resources suggest associated loci are related to the lower expression of(CREM) Increased(CREM) expression is also observed in early(E. histolytica) infection. Further,CREM mice were more susceptible to(E. histolytica) amebic colitis. These genetic associations reinforce the pathological similarities observed in gut inflammation between(E. histolytica) infection and IBD.(IMPORTANCE) Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death for children globally, causing 760,000 deaths each year in children less than 5 years old. Amebic dysentery contributes significantly to this burden, especially in developing countries. The identification of host factors that control or enable enteric pathogens has the potential to transform our understanding of disease predisposition, outcomes, and treatments. Our discovery of the transcriptional regulator cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) as a genetic modifier of susceptibility to amebic disease has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of other diarrheal infections. Further, emerging evidence for CREM in IBD susceptibility suggests that CREM is a critical regulator of enteric inflammation and may have broad therapeutic potential as a drug target across intestinal inflammatory diseases.
30237584	Genome-wide association analysis of common genetic variants of resistant hypertension.	Resistant hypertension (RHTN), defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140/90 using three or more drugs or controlled BP (<140/90) using four or more drugs, is associated with adverse outcomes, including decline in kidney function. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis in 1194 White and Hispanic participants with hypertension and coronary artery disease from the INternational VErapamil-SR Trandolapril STudy-GENEtic Substudy (INVEST-GENES). Top variants associated with RHTN at p < 10(-4) were tested for replication in 585 White and Hispanic participants with hypertension and subcortical strokes from the Secondary Prevention of Subcortical Strokes GENEtic Substudy (SPS3-GENES). A genetic risk score for RHTN was created by summing the risk alleles of replicated RHTN signals. rs11749255 in MSX2 was associated with RHTN in INVEST (odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) = 1.50 (1.2-1.8), p = 7.3 × 10(-5)) and replicated in SPS3 (OR = 2.0 (1.4-2.8), p = 4.3 × 10(-5)), with genome-wide significance in meta-analysis (OR = 1.60 (1.3-1.9), p = 3.8 × 10(-8)). Other replicated signals were in IFLTD1 and PTPRD. IFLTD1 rs6487504 was associated with RHTN in INVEST (OR = 1.90 (1.4-2.5), p = 1.1 × 10(-)(5)) and SPS3 (OR = 1.70 (1.2-2.5), p = 4 × 10(-3)). PTPRD rs324498, a previously reported RHTN signal, was among the top signals in INVEST (OR = 1.60 (1.3-2.0), p = 3.4 × 10(-)(5)) and replicated in SPS3 (OR = 1.60 (1.1-2.4), one-sided p = 0.005). Participants with the highest number of risk alleles were at increased risk of RHTN compared to participants with a lower number (p-trend = 1.8 × 10(-15)). Overall, we identified and replicated associations with RHTN in the MSX2, IFLTD1, and PTPRD regions, and combined these associations to create a genetic risk score.	
30242048	Genomic Analyses of Visual Cognition: Perceptual Rivalry and Top-Down Control.	Visual cognition in humans has traditionally been studied with cognitive behavioral methods and brain imaging, but much less with genetic methods. Perceptual rivalry, an important phenomenon in visual cognition, is the spontaneous perceptual alternation that occurs between two distinct interpretations of a physically constant visual stimulus (e.g., binocular rivalry stimuli) or a perceptually ambiguous stimulus (e.g., the Necker cube). The switching rate varies dramatically across individuals and can be voluntarily modulated by observers. Here, we adopted a genomic approach to systematically investigate the genetics underlying binocular rivalry, Necker cube rivalry and voluntary modulation of Necker cube rivalry in young Chinese adults ((Homo sapiens), 81% female, 20 ± 1 years old) at multiple levels, including common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimation, SNP-based genome-wide association study (GWAS), gene-based analysis, and pathway analysis. We performed a pilot GWAS in 2441 individuals and replicated it in an independent cohort of 943 individuals. Common SNP-based heritability was estimated to be 25% for spontaneous perceptual rivalry. SNPs rs184765639 and rs75595941 were associated with voluntary modulation, and imaging data suggested genotypic difference of rs184765639 in the surface area of the left caudal-middle frontal cortex. Additionally, converging evidence from multilevel analyses associated genes such as(PRMT1) with perceptual switching rate, and(MIR1178) with voluntary modulation strength. In summary, this study discovered specific genetic contributions to perceptual rivalry and its voluntary modulation in human beings. These findings may promote our understanding of psychiatric disorders, as perceptual rivalry is a potential psychiatric biomarker.(SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT) Perceptual rivalry is an important visual phenomenon in which our perception of a physically constant visual input spontaneously switches between two different states. There are individual variations in perceptual switching rate and voluntary modulation strength. Our genomic analyses reveal several loci associated with these two kinds of variation. Because perceptual rivalry is thought to be relevant to and potentially an endophenotype for psychiatric disorders, these results may help understand not only visual cognition, but also psychiatric disorders.	
30247649	Analysis of the genetic component of systemic sclerosis in Iranian and Turkish populations through a genome-wide association study.	SSc is an autoimmune disease characterized by alteration of the immune response, vasculopathy and fibrosis. Most genetic studies on SSc have been performed in European-ancestry populations. The aim of this study was to analyse the genetic component of SSc in Middle Eastern patients from Iran and Turkey through a genome-wide association study. This study analysed data from a total of 834 patients diagnosed with SSc and 1455 healthy controls from Iran and Turkey. DNA was genotyped using high-throughput genotyping platforms. The data generated were imputed using the Michigan Imputation Server, and the Haplotype Reference Consortium as a reference panel. A meta-analysis combining both case-control sets was conducted by the inverse variance method. The highest peak of association belonged to the HLA region in both the Iranian and Turkish populations. Strong and independent associations between the classical alleles HLA-DRB1*11: 04 [P = 2.10 × 10-24, odds ratio (OR) = 3.14] and DPB1*13: 01 (P = 5.37 × 10-14, OR = 5.75) and SSc were observed in the Iranian population. HLA-DRB1*11: 04 (P = 4.90 × 10-11, OR = 2.93) was the only independent signal associated in the Turkish cohort. An omnibus test yielded HLA-DRB1 58 and HLA-DPB1 76 as relevant amino acid positions for this disease. Concerning the meta-analysis, we also identified two associations close to the genome-wide significance level outside the HLA region, corresponding to IRF5-TNPO3 rs17424921-C (P = 1.34 × 10-7, OR = 1.68) and NFKB1 rs4648133-C (P = 3.11 × 10-7, OR = 1.47). We identified significant associations in the HLA region and suggestive associations in IRF5-TNPO3 and NFKB1 loci in Iranian and Turkish patients affected by SSc through a genome-wide association study and an extensive HLA analysis.	
30242241	Genome-wide analysis of polymorphism × sodium interaction effect on blood pressure identifies a novel 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus.	Excessive sodium intake is a global risk factor for hypertension. Sodium effects on blood pressure vary from person to person; hence, high-risk group targeting based on personal genetic information can play a complementary role to ongoing population preventive approaches to reduce sodium consumption. To identify genetic factors that modulate sodium effects on blood pressure, we conducted a population-based genome-wide interaction analysis in 8,768 Japanese subjects, which was >3 times larger than a similar previous study. We tested 7,135,436 polymorphisms in the discovery cohort, and loci that met suggestive significance were further examined in an independent replication cohort. We found that an interaction between a novel 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus and daily sodium consumption was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure in both discovery and replication cohorts under the recessive model. Further statistical analysis of rs8022678, the sentinel variant of the 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus, showed that differences in mean systolic blood pressure between high and low sodium consumption subgroups were 5.9 mm Hg (P = 8.8 × 10(-12)) in rs8022678 A carriers and -0.3 mm Hg (P = 0.27) in rs8022678 A non-carriers, suggesting that the rs8022678 genotype can classify persons into sodium-sensitive (A carriers) and sodium-insensitive (A non-carriers) subgroups. Our results implied that rs8022678 A carriers may receive a greater benefit from sodium-lowering interventions than non-carriers.	
30319691	Genome-Wide Association and Mechanistic Studies Indicate That Immune Response Contributes to Alzheimer's Disease Development.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Although genome-wide association study (GWAS) have reported hundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes linked to AD, the mechanisms about how these SNPs modulate the development of AD remain largely unknown. In this study, we performed GWAS for three traits in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and one clinical trait in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our analysis identified five most significant AD related SNPs (FDR < 0.05) within or proximal to APOE, APOC1, and TOMM40. One of the SNPs was co-inherited with APOE allele 4, which is the most important genetic risk factor for AD. Three of the five SNPs were located in promoter or enhancer regions, and transcription factor (TF) binding affinity calculations showed dramatic changes (| Log2FC| > 2) of three TFs (PLAG1, RREB1, and ZBTB33) for two motifs containing SNPs rs2075650 and rs157580. In addition, our GWAS showed that both rs2075650 and rs157580 were significantly associated with the poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2) gene (FDR < 0.25), which is involved in spreading of herpes simplex virus (HSV). The altered regulation of PVRL2 may increase the susceptibility AD patients to HSV and other virus infections of the brain. Our work suggests that AD is a type of immune disorder driven by viral or microbial infections of the brain during aging.	
30251476	Identification of a 3'-Untranslated Genetic Variant of RARB Associated With Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Genome-Wide Association Study.	To investigate the genetic background influencing the development of cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which, after quality control and imputation, a total of 6,308,944 polymorphisms across the whole genome were analyzed in 2,989 RA patients of European origin. Data on subclinical atherosclerosis, obtained through assessment of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and presence/absence of carotid plaques by carotid ultrasonography, were available for 1,355 individuals. A genetic variant of the RARB gene (rs116199914) was associated with CIMT values at the genome-wide level of significance (minor allele [G] β coefficient 0.142, P = 1.86 × 10(-8) ). Interestingly, rs116199914 overlapped with regulatory elements in tissues related to CV pathophysiology and immune cells. In addition, biologic pathway enrichment and predictive protein-protein relationship analyses, including suggestive GWAS signals of potential relevance, revealed a functional enrichment of the collagen biosynthesis network related to the presence/absence of carotid plaques (Gene Ontology no. 0032964; false discovery rate-adjusted P = 4.01 × 10(-3) ). Furthermore, our data suggest potential influences of the previously described candidate CV risk loci NFKB1, MSRA, and ZC3HC1 (P = 8.12 × 10(-4) , P = 5.94 × 10(-4) , and P = 2.46 × 10(-4) , respectively). The present findings strongly suggest that genetic variation within RARB contributes to the development of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with RA.	
30248107	Genome-wide association studies and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing identify regulatory variants influencing eyebrow thickness in humans.	Hair plays an important role in primates and is clearly subject to adaptive selection. While humans have lost most facial hair, eyebrows are a notable exception. Eyebrow thickness is heritable and widely believed to be subject to sexual selection. Nevertheless, few genomic studies have explored its genetic basis. Here, we performed a genome-wide scan for eyebrow thickness in 2961 Han Chinese. We identified two new loci of genome-wide significance, at 3q26.33 near SOX2 (rs1345417: P = 6.51×10(-10)) and at 5q13.2 near FOXD1 (rs12651896: P = 1.73×10(-8)). We further replicated our findings in the Uyghurs, a population from China characterized by East Asian-European admixture (N = 721), the CANDELA cohort from five Latin American countries (N = 2301), and the Rotterdam Study cohort of Dutch Europeans (N = 4411). A meta-analysis combining the full GWAS results from the three cohorts of full or partial Asian descent (Han Chinese, Uyghur and Latin Americans, N = 5983) highlighted a third signal of genome-wide significance at 2q12.3 (rs1866188: P = 5.81×10(-11)) near EDAR. We performed fine-mapping and prioritized four variants for further experimental verification. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing provided evidence that rs1345417 and rs12651896 affect the transcriptional activity of the nearby SOX2 and FOXD1 genes, which are both involved in hair development. Finally, suitable statistical analyses revealed that none of the associated variants showed clear signals of selection in any of the populations tested. Contrary to popular speculation, we found no evidence that eyebrow thickness is subject to strong selective pressure.	
30254083	First Genome-Wide Association Study of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults Reveals Novel Insights Linking Immune and Metabolic Diabetes.	Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) shares clinical features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes; however, there is ongoing debate regarding the precise definition of LADA. Understanding its genetic basis is one potential strategy to gain insight into appropriate classification of this diabetes subtype. We performed the first genome-wide association study of LADA in case subjects of European ancestry versus population control subjects ((n) = 2,634 vs. 5,947) and compared against both case subjects with type 1 diabetes ((n) = 2,454 vs. 968) and type 2 diabetes ((n) = 2,779 vs. 10,396). The leading genetic signals were principally shared with type 1 diabetes, although we observed positive genetic correlations genome-wide with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we observed a novel independent signal at the known type 1 diabetes locus harboring(PFKFB3), encoding a regulator of glycolysis and insulin signaling in type 2 diabetes and inflammation and autophagy in autoimmune disease, as well as an attenuation of key type 1-associated HLA haplotype frequencies in LADA, suggesting that these are factors that distinguish childhood-onset type 1 diabetes from adult autoimmune diabetes. Our results support the need for further investigations of the genetic factors that distinguish forms of autoimmune diabetes as well as more precise classification strategies.	
30258056	Genome-wide association study of 23,500 individuals identifies 7 loci associated with brain ventricular volume.	The volume of the lateral ventricles (LV) increases with age and their abnormal enlargement is a key feature of several neurological and psychiatric diseases. Although lateral ventricular volume is heritable, a comprehensive investigation of its genetic determinants is lacking. In this meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of 23,533 healthy middle-aged to elderly individuals from 26 population-based cohorts, we identify 7 genetic loci associated with LV volume. These loci map to chromosomes 3q28, 7p22.3, 10p12.31, 11q23.1, 12q23.3, 16q24.2, and 22q13.1 and implicate pathways related to tau pathology, S1P signaling, and cytoskeleton organization. We also report a significant genetic overlap between the thalamus and LV volumes (ρ(genetic) = -0.59, p-value = 3.14 × 10(-6)), suggesting that these brain structures may share a common biology. These genetic associations of LV volume provide insights into brain morphology.	
30363675	Using Adipose Measures from Health Care Provider-Based Imaging Data for Discovery.	The location and type of adipose tissue is an important factor in metabolic syndrome. A database of picture archiving and communication system (PACS) derived abdominal computerized tomography (CT) images from a large health care provider, Geisinger, was used for large-scale research of the relationship of volume of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) with obesity-related diseases and clinical laboratory measures. Using a "greedy snake" algorithm and 2,545 CT images from the Geisinger PACS, we measured levels of VAT, SAT, total adipose tissue (TAT), and adipose ratio volumes. Sex-combined and sex-stratified association testing was done between adipose measures and 1,233 disease diagnoses and 37 clinical laboratory measures. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for adipose measures was also performed. SAT was strongly associated with obesity and morbid obesity. VAT levels were strongly associated with type 2 diabetes-related diagnoses ((p) = 1.5 × 10(-58)), obstructive sleep apnea ((p) = 7.7 × 10(-37)), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels ((p) = 1.42 × 10(-36)), triglyceride levels ((p) = 1.44 × 10(-43)), and white blood cell (WBC) counts ((p) = 7.37 × 10(-9)). Sex-stratified tests revealed stronger associations among women, indicating the increased influence of VAT on obesity-related disease outcomes particularly among women. The GWAS identified some suggestive associations. This study supports the utility of pursuing future clinical and genetic discoveries with existing imaging data-derived adipose tissue measures deployed at a larger scale.	
30265060	Genetic influences on delayed reward discounting: A genome-wide prioritized subset approach.	Delayed reward discounting (DRD) is a behavioral economic measure of impulsivity that has been consistently associated with addiction. It has also been identified as a promising addiction endophenotype, linking specific sources of genetic variation to individual risk. A challenge in the studies to date is that levels of DRD are often confounded with prior drug use, and previous studies have also had limited genomic scope. The current investigation sought to address these issues by studying DRD in healthy young adults with low levels of substance use (N = 986; 62% female, 100% European ancestry) and investigating genetic variation genome-wide. The genome-wide approach used a prioritized subset design, organizing the tests into theoretically and empirically informed categories and apportioning power accordingly. Three subsets were used: (a) a priori loci implicated by previous studies; (b) high-value addiction (HVA) markers from the recently developed SmokeScreen array; and (c) an atheoretical genome-wide scan. Among a priori loci, a nominally significant association was present between DRD and rs521674 in ADRA2A. No significant HVA loci were detected. One statistically significant genome-wide association was detected (rs13395777, p = 2.8 × 10-8), albeit in an intergenic region of unknown function. These findings are generally not supportive of the previous candidate gene studies and suggest that DRD has a complex genetic architecture that will require considerably larger samples to identify genetic associations more definitively.

30261039	Genome-wide meta-analysis of 158,000 individuals of European ancestry identifies three loci associated with chronic back pain.	Back pain is the #1 cause of years lived with disability worldwide, yet surprisingly little is known regarding the biology underlying this symptom. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of chronic back pain (CBP). Adults of European ancestry were included from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and from the UK Biobank interim data release. CBP cases were defined as those reporting back pain present for ≥3-6 months; non-cases were included as comparisons ("controls"). Each cohort conducted genotyping using commercially available arrays followed by imputation. GWAS used logistic regression models with additive genetic effects, adjusting for age, sex, study-specific covariates, and population substructure. The threshold for genome-wide significance in the fixed-effect inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was p<5×10(-8). Suggestive (p<5×10(-7)) and genome-wide significant (p<5×10(-8)) variants were carried forward for replication or further investigation in the remaining UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample. The discovery sample comprised 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 CBP cases. A genome-wide significant association was found for the intronic variant rs12310519 in SOX5 (OR 1.08, p = 7.2×10(-10)). This was subsequently replicated in 283,752 UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample, including 50,915 cases (OR 1.06, p = 5.3×10(-11)), and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis (OR 1.07, p = 4.5×10(-19)). We found suggestive associations at three other loci in the discovery sample, two of which exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant, rs7833174, located between CCDC26 and GSDMC (OR 1.05, p = 4.4×10(-13)), and an intronic variant, rs4384683, in DCC (OR 0.97, p = 2.4×10(-10)). In this first reported meta-analysis of GWAS for CBP, we identified and replicated a genetic locus associated with CBP (SOX5). We also identified 2 other loci that reached genome-wide significance in a 2-stage joint meta-analysis (CCDC26/GSDMC and DCC).	
30266756	Common variants at 5q33.1 predispose to migraine in African-American children.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple susceptibility loci for migraine in European adults. However, no large-scale genetic studies have been performed in children or African Americans with migraine. We conducted a GWAS of 380 African-American children and 2129 ancestry-matched controls to identify variants associated with migraine. We then attempted to replicate our primary analysis in an independent cohort of 233 African-American patients and 4038 non-migraine control subjects. The results of this study indicate that common variants at 5q33.1 associated with migraine risk in African-American children (rs72793414, p=1.94×10(-9)). The association was validated in an independent study (p=3.87×10(-3)) for an overall meta-analysis p value of 3.81×10(-10). eQTL (Expression quantitative trait loci) analysis of the Genotype-Tissue Expression data also shows the genotypes of rs72793414 were strongly correlated with the mRNA expression levels of(NMUR2) at 5q33.1.(NMUR2) encodes a G protein-coupled receptor of neuromedin-U (NMU). NMU, a highly conserved neuropeptide, participates in diverse physiological processes of the central nervous system. This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of childhood migraine and allow for precision therapeutic development strategies targeting migraine patients of African-American ancestry.	
30267110	Identification of the TIFAB Gene as a Susceptibility Locus for Coronary Artery Aneurysm in Patients with Kawasaki Disease.	Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limiting systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. KD is often complicated by coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs), which develop in about 20-25% of untreated children and 3-5% of children treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. To identify the risk loci for CAA susceptibility in patients with KD, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using our previous Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 KD patients) and a new replication study in an independent sample set (713 KD patients) by grouping KD patients without CAA (control) versus KD patients with extremely large aneurysms (diameter ≥ 5 mm) (case). Among 44 candidate single -nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from the initial GWAS data (33 cases vs. 215 controls), a SNP (rs899162) located 7 kb upstream of the TIFAB gene on chromosome five was replicated in an independent sample (12 cases vs. 532 controls). In the combined analysis (45 cases vs. 747 controls), the SNP (rs899162) showed a highly significant association with CAA formation (diameter ≥ 5 mm) in patients with KD (odds ratio = 3.20, 95% confidence interval = 2.02-5.05, P(combined) = 1.95 × 10(-7)). These results indicate that the TIFAB gene may act as a CAA susceptibility locus in patients with KD.	
30266950	A variant at 9q34.11 is associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative essential hypersomnia.	Essential hypersomnia (EHS) is a lifelong disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness without cataplexy. EHS is associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*06:02, similar to narcolepsy with cataplexy (narcolepsy). Previous studies suggest that DQB1*06:02-positive and -negative EHS are different in terms of their clinical features and follow different pathological pathways. DQB1*06:02-positive EHS and narcolepsy share the same susceptibility genes. In the present study, we report a genome-wide association study with replication for DQB1*06:02-negative EHS (408 patients and 2247 healthy controls, all Japanese). One single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs10988217, which is located 15-kb upstream of carnitine O-acetyltransferase (CRAT), was significantly associated with DQB1*06:02-negative EHS (P = 7.5 × 10(-9), odds ratio = 2.63). The risk allele of the disease-associated SNP was correlated with higher expression levels of CRAT in various tissues and cell types, including brain tissue. In addition, the risk allele was associated with levels of succinylcarnitine (P = 1.4 × 10(-18)) in human blood. The leading SNP in this region was the same in associations with both DQB1*06:02-negative EHS and succinylcarnitine levels. The results suggest that DQB1*06:02-negative EHS may be associated with an underlying dysfunction in energy metabolic pathways.	
30276832	Meta-Analysis of Genetic Influences on Initial Alcohol Sensitivity.	Previous studies indicate that low initial sensitivity to alcohol may be a risk factor for later alcohol misuse. Evidence suggests that initial sensitivity is influenced by genetic factors, but few molecular genetic studies have been reported. We conducted a meta-analysis of 2 population-based genome-wide association studies of the Self-Rating of the Effects of Alcohol scale. Our final sample consisted of 7,339 individuals (82.3% of European descent; 59.2% female) who reported having used alcohol at least 5 times. In addition, we estimated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and conducted a series of secondary aggregate genetic analyses. No individual locus reached genome-wide significance. Gene and set based analyses, both overall and using tissue-specific expression data, yielded largely null results, and genes previously implicated in alcohol problems and consumption were overall not associated with initial sensitivity. Only 1 gene set, related to hormone signaling and including core clock genes, survived correction for multiple testing. A meta-analysis of SNP-based heritability resulted in a modest estimate of h  = 0.19 (SE = 0.10), though this was driven by 1 sample (N = 3,683,h = 0.36, SE = 0.14, p = 0.04). No significant genetic correlations with other relevant outcomes were observed. Findings yielded only modest support for a genetic component underlying initial alcohol sensitivity. Results suggest that its biological underpinnings may diverge somewhat from that of other alcohol outcomes and may be related to core clock genes or other aspects of hormone signaling. Larger samples, ideally of prospectively assessed samples, are likely necessary to improve gene identification efforts and confirm the current findings.
30305239	Genetic contributors to serum uric acid levels in Mexicans and their effect on premature coronary artery disease.	Serum uric acid (SUA) is a heritable trait associated with cardiovascular risk factors and coronary artery disease (CAD). Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genes associated with SUA, mainly in European populations. However, to date there are few GWAS in Latino populations, and the role of SUA-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cardiovascular disease has not been studied in the Mexican population. We performed genome-wide SUA association study in 2153 Mexican children and adults, evaluated whether genetic effects were modified by sex and obesity, and used a Mendelian randomization approach in an independent cohort to study the role of SUA modifying genetic variants in premature CAD. Only two loci were associated with SUA levels: SLC2A9 (β = -0.47 mg/dl, P = 1.57 × 10(-42) for lead SNP rs7678287) and ABCG2 (β = 0.23 mg/dl, P = 2.42 × 10(-10) for lead SNP rs2231142). No significant interaction between SLC2A9 rs7678287 and ABCG2 rs2231142 genotypes and obesity was observed. However, a significant ABCG2 rs2231142 genotype*sex interaction (P = 0.001) was observed in adults but not in children. Although SUA levels were associated with premature CAD, metabolic syndrome and decreased glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), only ABCG2 rs2231142 was associated with decreased eGFR in the premature CAD group. SUA elevation was independently associated with premature CAD, metabolic syndrome and decreased eGFR in the Mexican population. However, a Mendelian randomization approach using the lead SUA-associated SNPs (SLC2A9 and ABCG2) did not support a causal role of elevated SUA levels for premature CAD.	
30357299	Association of Genetic Variants With Warfarin-Associated Bleeding Among Patients of African Descent.	Major warfarin-related bleeding occurs more frequently in African Americans than in other populations. Identification of potential genetic factors related to this adverse event may help identify at-risk patients. To identify genetic factors associated with warfarin-related bleeding in patients of African descent at an international normalized ratio (INR) of less than 4. A case-control genome-wide association study involving patients of African descent taking warfarin was conducted in a discovery cohort (University of Chicago [2009-2011] and the University of Illinois at Chicago [2002-2011]), and associations were confirmed in a replication cohort (University of Chicago [2015-2016]). Potential population stratification was examined in the discovery cohort by principal component analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were computed for bleeding risk by logistic regression analysis. Summary statistics from the discovery and the replication cohorts were analyzed with a fixed effects meta-analysis. The potential influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene expression was studied by luciferase expression assays. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with warfarin-related bleeding. Major bleeding-defined as bleeding requiring hospitalization, causing a decrease in hemoglobin level of more than 2 g/dL, requiring blood transfusion, or any combination of the 3-while taking warfarin at an INR of less than 4. The discovery cohort consisted of 31 cases (mean age, 60.1 years [SD, 14.9 years], 26 women [83.9%]) and 184 warfarin-treated controls (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 15.7 years]) with no documented bleeding. The replication cohort consisted of 40 cases (mean age, 55.6 years [SD, 17.3 years], 27 women [67.5%]), and 148 warfarin-treated controls (mean age, 55.4 years [SD, 17.1 years]; 98 women [66.2%]) with no documented bleeding. In the discovery cohort, 4 SNPs in linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 6 (rs115112393, rs16871327, rs78132896, and rs114504854) were associated with warfarin-related bleeding but did not reach genome-wide significance. The SNP rs78132896 occurred in 11 cases (35.5%) and 9 controls (4.9%) in the discovery cohort (OR, 8.31; 95% CI, 3.2-21.5; P < 6.21 × 10-8), and the association was confirmed in the replication cohort (the SNP was present in 14 cases [35.0%] and 7 controls [4.8%]; OR, 8.24; 95% CI, 3.1-25.3, P = 5.64 × 10-5). Genome-wide significance of this SNP was achieved when the cohorts were combined via meta-analysis (OR, 8.27; 95% CI, 4.18-16.38; P = 2.05 × 10-11). These SNPs are found only in people of African descent. In vitro luciferase expression assays demonstrated that rs16871327 (enhancer SNP) and rs78132896 (promoter SNP) risk alleles together increased EPHA7 gene (Entrez Gene 2045) transcription by a mean of 14.95 (SD, 1.7) compared with wild-type alleles (mean, 9.56 [SD, 0.84]; difference, 5.39; 95% CI, 4.1-6.6; P < .001). In this preliminary study involving patients of African descent taking warfarin, 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 6 were associated with an increased risk of major bleeding at INR of less than 4. Validation of these findings in an independent prospective cohort is required.	
30275531	Genetics of blood lipids among ~300,000 multi-ethnic participants of the Million Veteran Program.	The Million Veteran Program (MVP) was established in 2011 as a national research initiative to determine how genetic variation influences the health of US military veterans. Here we genotyped 312,571 MVP participants using a custom biobank array and linked the genetic data to laboratory and clinical phenotypes extracted from electronic health records covering a median of 10.0 years of follow-up. Among 297,626 veterans with at least one blood lipid measurement, including 57,332 black and 24,743 Hispanic participants, we tested up to around 32 million variants for association with lipid levels and identified 118 novel genome-wide significant loci after meta-analysis with data from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (total n > 600,000). Through a focus on mutations predicted to result in a loss of gene function and a phenome-wide association study, we propose novel indications for pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting PCSK9 (abdominal aortic aneurysm), ANGPTL4 (type 2 diabetes) and PDE3B (triglycerides and coronary disease).	
30279459	Brain scans from 21,297 individuals reveal the genetic architecture of hippocampal subfield volumes.	The hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure, comprising histologically distinguishable subfields. These subfields are differentially involved in memory consolidation, spatial navigation and pattern separation, complex functions often impaired in individuals with brain disorders characterized by reduced hippocampal volume, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. Given the structural and functional heterogeneity of the hippocampal formation, we sought to characterize the subfields' genetic architecture. T1-weighted brain scans (n = 21,297, 16 cohorts) were processed with the hippocampal subfields algorithm in FreeSurfer v6.0. We ran a genome-wide association analysis on each subfield, co-varying for whole hippocampal volume. We further calculated the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of 12 subfields, as well as their genetic correlation with each other, with other structural brain features and with AD and schizophrenia. All outcome measures were corrected for age, sex and intracranial volume. We found 15 unique genome-wide significant loci across six subfields, of which eight had not been previously linked to the hippocampus. Top SNPs were mapped to genes associated with neuronal differentiation, locomotor behaviour, schizophrenia and AD. The volumes of all the subfields were estimated to be heritable (h2 from 0.14 to 0.27, all p < 1 × 10(-16)) and clustered together based on their genetic correlations compared with other structural brain features. There was also evidence of genetic overlap of subicular subfield volumes with schizophrenia. We conclude that hippocampal subfields have partly distinct genetic determinants associated with specific biological processes and traits. Taking into account this specificity may increase our understanding of hippocampal neurobiology and associated pathologies.	
30281099	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies BARX1 and EML4-MTA3 as new loci associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.	Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a disorder of young infants with a population incidence of ∼2/1000 live births, caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter smooth muscle. Reported genetic loci associated with IHPS explain only a minor proportion of IHPS risk. To identify new risk loci, we carried out a genome-wide meta-analysis on 1395 surgery-confirmed cases and 4438 controls, with replication in a set of 2427 cases and 2524 controls. We identified and replicated six independent genomic loci associated with IHPS risk at genome wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8), including novel associations with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One of these SNPs, rs6736913 [odds ratio (OR) = 2.32; P = 3.0 × 10-15], is a low frequency missense variant in EML4 at 2p21. The second SNP, rs1933683 (OR = 1.34; P = 3.1 × 10-9) is 1 kb downstream of BARX1 at 9q22.32, an essential gene for stomach formation in embryogenesis. Using the genome-wide complex trait analysis method, we estimated the IHPS SNP heritability to be 30%, and using the linkage disequilibrium score regression method, we found support for a previously reported genetic correlation of IHPS with lipid metabolism. By combining the largest collection of IHPS cases to date (3822 cases), with results generalized across populations of different ancestry, we elucidate novel mechanistic avenues of IHPS disease architecture.	
30279531	A genetic perspective on the relationship between eudaimonic -and hedonic well-being.	Whether hedonism or eudaimonia are two distinguishable forms of well-being is a topic of ongoing debate. To shed light on the relation between the two, large-scale available molecular genetic data were leveraged to gain more insight into the genetic architecture of the overlap between hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. Hence, we conducted the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of eudaimonic well-being (N = ~108 K) and linked it to a GWAS of hedonic well-being (N = ~222 K). We identified the first two genome-wide significant independent loci for eudaimonic well-being and six independent loci for hedonic well-being. Joint analyses revealed a moderate phenotypic correlation (r = 0.53) and a high genetic correlation (r(g) = 0.78) between eudaimonic and hedonic well-being. This indicates that the genetic etiology of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being is substantially shared, with divergent (environmental) factors contributing to their phenotypic divergence. Loci regulating expression showed significant enrichment in the brain cortex, brain cerebellum, frontal cortex, as well as the cerebellar hemisphere for eudaimonic well-being. No significant enrichment for hedonic well-being is observed, although brain tissues were top ranked. Genetic correlations patterns with a range of positive and negative related phenotypes were largely similar for hedonic -and eudaimonic well-being. Our results reveal a large overlap between the genes that influence hedonism and the genes that influence eudaimonia.	
30285260	Genome-Wide Association Study Detected Novel Susceptibility Genes for Schizophrenia and Shared Trans-Populations/Diseases Genetic Effect.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified >100 susceptibility loci for schizophrenia (SCZ) and demonstrated that SCZ is a polygenic disorder determined by numerous genetic variants but with small effect size. We conducted a GWAS in the Japanese (JPN) population (a) to detect novel SCZ-susceptibility genes and (b) to examine the shared genetic risk of SCZ across (East Asian [EAS] and European [EUR]) populations and/or that of trans-diseases (SCZ, bipolar disorder [BD], and major depressive disorder [MDD]) within EAS and between EAS and EUR (trans-diseases/populations). Among the discovery GWAS subjects (JPN-SCZ GWAS: 1940 SCZ cases and 7408 controls) and replication dataset (4071 SCZ cases and 54479 controls), both comprising JPN populations, 3 novel susceptibility loci for SCZ were identified: SPHKAP (Pbest = 4.1 × 10-10), SLC38A3 (Pbest = 5.7 × 10-10), and CABP1-ACADS (Pbest = 9.8 × 10-9). Subsequent meta-analysis between our samples and those of the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium (PGC; EUR samples) and another study detected 12 additional susceptibility loci. Polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction revealed a shared genetic risk of SCZ across populations (Pbest = 4.0 × 10-11) and between SCZ and BD in the JPN population (P ~ 10-40); however, a lower variance-explained was noted between JPN-SCZ GWAS and PGC-BD or MDD within/across populations. Genetic correlation analysis supported the PRS results; the genetic correlation between JPN-SCZ and PGC-SCZ was ρ = 0.58, whereas a similar/lower correlation was observed between the trans-diseases (JPN-SCZ vs JPN-BD/EAS-MDD, rg = 0.56/0.29) or trans-diseases/populations (JPN-SCZ vs PGC-BD/MDD, ρ = 0.38/0.12). In conclusion, (a) Fifteen novel loci are possible susceptibility genes for SCZ and (b) SCZ "risk" effect is shared with other psychiatric disorders even across populations.	
30281874	Genome-wide association study identifies gastric cancer susceptibility loci at 12q24.11-12 and 20q11.21.	Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality in Japan and worldwide. Although previous studies identify various genetic variations associated with gastric cancer, host genetic factors are largely unidentified. To identify novel gastric cancer loci in the Japanese population, herein, we carried out a large-scale genome-wide association study using 6171 cases and 27 178 controls followed by three replication analyses. Analysis using a total of 11 507 cases and 38 904 controls identified two novel loci on 12q24.11-12 (rs6490061, P = 3.20 × 10(-8) with an odds ratio [OR] of 0.905) and 20q11.21 (rs2376549, P = 8.11 × 10(-10) with an OR of 1.109). rs6490061 is located at intron 19 of the CUX2 gene, and its expression was suppressed by Helicobacter pylori infection. rs2376549 is included within the gene cluster of DEFB families that encode antibacterial peptides. We also found a significant association of rs7849280 in the ABO gene locus on 9q34.2 (P = 2.64 × 10(-13) with an OR of 1.148). CUX2 and ABO expression in gastric mucosal tissues was significantly associated with rs6490061 and rs7849280 (P = 0.0153 and 8.00 × 10(-11) ), respectively. Our findings show the crucial roles of genetic variations in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.	
30284222	Genome-wide association analysis suggests novel loci for Hashimoto's thyroiditis.	Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common form of autoimmune thyroid diseases. Current knowledge of HT genetics is limited, and not a single genome-wide association study (GWAS) focusing exclusively on HT has been performed to date. In order to decipher genetic determinants of HT, we performed the first GWAS followed by replication in a total of 1443 individuals from Croatia. We performed association analysis in a discovery cohort comprising 405 cases and 433 controls. We followed up 13 independent signals (P < 10(-5)) in 303 cases and 302 controls from two replication cohorts and then meta-analyzed results across discovery and replication datasets. We identified three variants suggestively associated with HT: rs12944194 located 206 kb from SDK2 (P = 1.8 × 10(-6)), rs75201096 inside GNA14 (P = 2.41 × 10(-5)) and rs791903 inside IP6K3 (P = 3.16 × 10(-5)). Genetic risk score (GRS), calculated using risk alleles of these loci, accounted for 4.82% of the total HT variance, and individuals from the top GRS quartile had 2.76 times higher odds for HT than individuals from the lowest GRS quartile. Although discovered loci are implicated with susceptibility to HT for the first time, genomic regions harboring these loci exhibit good biological candidacy due to involvement in the regulation of the thyroid function and autoimmunity. Additionally, we observe genetic overlap between HT and several related traits, such as hypothyroidism, Graves' disease and TPOAb. Our study adds a new knowledge of underlying HT genetics and sets a firm basis for further research.	
30287865	Genome-wide association study reveals novel genetic locus associated with intra-individual variability in response time.	Intra-individual response time variability (IIRTV) is proposed as a viable endophenotype for many psychiatric disorders, particularly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here we assessed whether IIRTV was associated with common DNA variation genome-wide and whether IIRTV mediated the relationship between any associated loci and self-reported ADHD symptoms. A final data set from 857 Australian young adults (489 females and 368 males; M(age) = 22.14 years, SD(age) = 4.82 years) who completed five response time tasks and self-reported symptoms of ADHD using the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale was used. Principal components analysis (PCA) on these response time measures (standard deviation of reaction times and the intra-individual coefficient of variation) produced two variability factors (labelled response selection and selective attention). To understand the genetic drivers of IIRTV we performed a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) on these PCA-derived indices of IIRTV. For the selective attention variability factor, we identified one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) attaining genome-wide significance; rs62182100 in the HDAC4 gene located on chromosome 2q37. A bootstrapping mediation analysis demonstrated that the selective attention variability factor mediated the relationship between rs62182100 and self-reported ADHD symptoms. Our findings provide the first evidence of a genome-wide significant SNP association with IIRTV and support the potential utility of IIRTV as a valid endophenotype for ADHD symptoms. However, limitations of this study suggest that these observations should be interpreted with caution until replication samples become available.	
30287856	Genome-wide association study identifies two risk loci for tuberculosis in Han Chinese.	Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and remains a leading public health problem. Previous studies have identified host genetic factors that contribute to Mtb infection outcomes. However, much of the heritability in TB remains unaccounted for and additional susceptibility loci most likely exist. We perform a multistage genome-wide association study on 2949 pulmonary TB patients and 5090 healthy controls (833 cases and 1220 controls were genome-wide genotyped) from Han Chinese population. We discover two risk loci: 14q24.3 (rs12437118, P(combined) = 1.72 × 10(-11), OR = 1.277, ESRRB) and 20p13 (rs6114027, P(combined) = 2.37 × 10(-11), OR = 1.339, TGM6). Moreover, we determine that the rs6114027 risk allele is related to decreased TGM6 transcripts in PBMCs from pulmonary TB patients and severer pulmonary TB disease. Furthermore, we find that tgm6-deficient mice are more susceptible to Mtb infection. Our results provide new insights into the genetic etiology of TB.	
30284742	A genome-wide association study identifies an association between variants in EFCAB4B gene and periodontal disease in an Italian isolated population.	Periodontitis in one of the most prevalent dental diseases. Despite numerous studies have investigated its aetiopathogenetic factors, few works have focused on its genetic predisposition and most of them took into account only candidate genes. Therefore, we conducted a Genome Wide Association Study in an Italian isolated population aimed at uncovering genetic variants that predispose to this disorder. Diagnosis of chronic periodontitis was made following the criteria of the American Academy of Periodontology. Patients with chronic periodontitis were grouped into different categories: slight, severe, localized and generalized. A control group composed by people without signs of periodontitis or gingivitis was defined. DNA was genotyped using 370k Illumina chips. Linear mixed model regression was used to test the association between each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (independent variable) and the periodontitis status (dependent variable), controlling for confounders sex, age and smoking. The genomic kinship matrix was also used as random effect. Four SNPs on the gene EFCAB4B resulted significantly associated to localized periodontitis (P < 5 × 10(-8) ), with the best hit on the rs242016 SNP (P = 1.5 × 10(-8) ). We have identified a novel significant association between the EFCAB4B gene and localized periodontitis. These results open a new perspective in the understanding of genetic factors contributing to this common disorder.	
30287806	Genome-wide association study identifies glutamate ionotropic receptor GRIA4 as a risk gene for comorbid nicotine dependence and major depression.	Smoking and major depression frequently co-occur, at least in part due to shared genetic risk. However, the nature of the shared genetic basis is poorly understood. To detect genetic risk variants for comorbid nicotine dependence (ND) and major depression (MD), we conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two samples of African-American participants (Yale-Penn 1 and 2) using linear mixed model, followed by meta-analysis. 3724 nicotine-exposed subjects were analyzed: 2596 from Yale-Penn-1 and 1128 from Yale-Penn-2. Continuous measures (Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores and DSM-IV MD criteria) rather than disorder status were used to maximize the power of the GWAS. Genotypes were ascertained using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad array (Yale-Penn-1 sample) or the Illumina HumanCore Exome array (Yale-Penn-2 sample), followed by imputation based on the 1000 Genomes reference panel. An intronic variant at the GRIA4 locus, rs68081839, was significantly associated with ND-MD comorbidity (β = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.43-0.89], P = 1.53 × 10(-8)). GRIA4 encodes an AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor that mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuroplasticity. Conditional analyses revealed that the association was explained jointly by both traits. Enrichment analysis showed that the top risk genes and genes co-expressed with GRIA4 are enriched in cell adhesion, calcium ion binding, and synapses. They also have enriched expression in the brain and they have been implicated in the risk for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Further research is needed to determine the replicability of these findings and to identify the biological mechanisms through which genetic risk for each condition is conveyed.	
30289880	Heritability informed power optimization (HIPO) leads to enhanced detection of genetic associations across multiple traits.	Genome-wide association studies have shown that pleiotropy is a common phenomenon that can potentially be exploited for enhanced detection of susceptibility loci. We propose heritability informed power optimization (HIPO) for conducting powerful pleiotropic analysis using summary-level association statistics. We find optimal linear combinations of association coefficients across traits that are expected to maximize non-centrality parameter for the underlying test statistics, taking into account estimates of heritability, sample size variations and overlaps across the traits. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has correct type I error, robust to population stratification and leads to desired genome-wide enrichment of association signals. Application of the proposed method to publicly available data for three groups of genetically related traits, lipids (N = 188,577), psychiatric diseases (Ncase = 33,332, Ncontrol = 27,888) and social science traits (N ranging between 161,460 to 298,420 across individual traits) increased the number of genome-wide significant loci by 12%, 200% and 50%, respectively, compared to those found by analysis of individual traits. Evidence of replication is present for many of these loci in subsequent larger studies for individual traits. HIPO can potentially be extended to high-dimensional phenotypes as a way of dimension reduction to maximize power for subsequent genetic association testing.	
30338293	Plasticity-related gene 3 (	To identify modifiers of age at diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) included 1,950 individuals with PD from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium (NGRC) study. Replication was conducted in the Parkinson's, Genes and Environment study, including 209 prevalent (PAGE(P)) and 517 incident (PAGE(I)) PD cases. Cox regression was used to test association with age at diagnosis. Individuals without neurologic disease were used to rule out confounding. Gene-level analysis and functional annotation were conducted using Functional Mapping and Annotation of GWAS platform (FUMA). The GWAS revealed 2 linked but seemingly independent association signals that mapped to(LPPR1) on chromosome 9.(LPPR1) was significant in gene-based analysis ((p) = 1E-8). The top signal (rs17763929, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.88,(p) = 5E-8) replicated in PAGE(P) (HR = 1.87,(p) = 0.01) but not in PAGE(I). The second signal (rs73656147) was robust with no evidence of heterogeneity (HR = 1.95,(p) = 3E-6 in NGRC; HR = 2.14,(p) = 1E-3 in PAGE(P) + PAGE(I), and HR = 2.00,(p) = 9E-9 in meta-analysis of NGRC + PAGE(P) + PAGE(I)). The associations were with age at diagnosis, not confounded by age in patients or in the general population. The PD-associated regions included variants with Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores = 10-19 (top 1%-10% most deleterious mutations in the genome), a missense with predicted destabilizing effect on LPPR1, an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for(GRIN3A) (false discovery rate [FDR] = 4E-4), and variants that overlap with enhancers in(LPPR1) and interact with promoters of(LPPR1) and 9 other brain-expressed genes (Hi-C FDR < 1E-6). Through association with age at diagnosis, we uncovered(LPPR1) as a modifier gene for PD.(LPPR1) expression promotes neuronal regeneration after injury in animal models. Present data provide a strong foundation for mechanistic studies to test(LPPR1) as a driver of response to damage and a therapeutic target for enhancing neuroregeneration and slowing disease progression.	
30298529	The eMERGE genotype set of 83,717 subjects imputed to ~40 million variants genome wide and association with the herpes zoster medical record phenotype.	The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network is a network of medical centers with electronic medical records linked to existing biorepository samples for genomic discovery and genomic medicine research. The network sought to unify the genetic results from 78 Illumina and Affymetrix genotype array batches from 12 contributing medical centers for joint association analysis of 83,717 human participants. In this report, we describe the imputation of eMERGE results and methods to create the unified imputed merged set of genome-wide variant genotype data. We imputed the data using the Michigan Imputation Server, which provides a missing single-nucleotide variant genotype imputation service using the minimac3 imputation algorithm with the Haplotype Reference Consortium genotype reference set. We describe the quality control and filtering steps used in the generation of this data set and suggest generalizable quality thresholds for imputation and phenotype association studies. To test the merged imputed genotype set, we replicated a previously reported chromosome 6 HLA-B herpes zoster (shingles) association and discovered a novel zoster-associated loci in an epigenetic binding site near the terminus of chromosome 3 (3p29).	
30299488	Genome-Wide Association Study of Susceptibility Loci for Radiation-Induced Brain Injury.	Radiation-induced brain injury is a nonnegligible issue in the management of cancer patients treated by partial or whole brain irradiation. In particular, temporal lobe injury (TLI), a deleterious late complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, greatly affects the long-term life quality of these patients. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with radiation toxicity, genetic variants contributing to the radiation-induced brain injury have not yet been assessed. We recruited and performed follow-up for a prospective observational cohort, Genetic Architecture of Radiotherapy Toxicity and Prognosis, using magnetic resonance imaging for TLI diagnosis. We conducted genome-wide association analysis in 1082 patients and validated the top associations in two independent cohorts of 1119 and 741 patients, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided. We identified a promoter variant rs17111237 (A > G, minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.14) in CEP128 associated with TLI risk (hazard ratio = 1.45, 95% confidence interval = 1.26 to 1.66, Pcombined=3.18 × 10-7) which is in moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs162171 (MAF = 0.18, R2 = 0.69), the top signal in CEP128 (hazard ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval = 1.29-1.66, Pcombined= 6.17 × 10-9). Combining the clinical variables with the top SNP, we divided the patients into different subgroups with varying risk with 5-year TLI-free rates ranging from 33.7% to 95.5%. CEP128, a key component of mother centriole, tightly interacts with multiple radiation-resistant genes and plays an important role in maintaining the functional cilia, which otherwise will lead to a malfunction of the neural network. We found that A > G alteration at rs17111237 impaired the promoter activity of CEP128 and knockdown of CEP128 decreased the clonogenic cell survival of U87 cells under radiation. Noteworthy, 12.7% (27/212) of the GWAS-based associated genes (P < .001) were enriched in the neurogenesis pathway. This three-stage study is the first GWAS of radiation-induced brain injury that implicates the genetic susceptibility gene CEP128 involved in TLI development and provides the novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of radiation-induced brain injury.	
30297428	Genetic variation in the 	Erectile dysfunction affects millions of men worldwide. Twin studies support the role of genetic risk factors underlying erectile dysfunction, but no specific genetic variants have been identified. We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study of erectile dysfunction in 36,649 men in the multiethnic Kaiser Permanente Northern California Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging cohort. We also undertook replication analyses in 222,358 men from the UK Biobank. In the discovery cohort, we identified a single locus (rs17185536-T) on chromosome 6 near the single-minded family basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1 ((SIM1)) gene that was significantly associated with the risk of erectile dysfunction (odds ratio = 1.26,(P) = 3.4 × 10(-25)). The association replicated in the UK Biobank sample (odds ratio = 1.25,(P) = 6.8 × 10(-14)), and the effect is independent of known erectile dysfunction risk factors, including body mass index (BMI). The risk locus resides on the same topologically associating domain as(SIM1) and interacts with the(SIM1) promoter, and the rs17185536-T risk allele showed differential enhancer activity.(SIM1) is part of the leptin-melanocortin system, which has an established role in body weight homeostasis and sexual function. Because the variants associated with erectile dysfunction are not associated with differences in BMI, our findings suggest a mechanism that is specific to sexual function.	
30306274	Genome-wide association studies for corneal and refractive astigmatism in UK Biobank demonstrate a shared role for myopia susceptibility loci.	Previous studies have suggested that naturally occurring genetic variation contributes to the risk of astigmatism. The purpose of this investigation was to identify genetic markers associated with corneal and refractive astigmatism in a large-scale European ancestry cohort (UK Biobank) who underwent keratometry and autorefraction at an assessment centre. Genome-wide association studies for corneal and refractive astigmatism were performed in individuals of European ancestry (N = 86,335 and 88,005 respectively), with the mean corneal astigmatism or refractive astigmatism in fellow eyes analysed as a quantitative trait (dependent variable). Genetic correlation between the two traits was calculated using LD Score regression. Gene-based and gene-set tests were carried out using MAGMA. Single marker-based association tests for corneal astigmatism identified four genome-wide significant loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)) near the genes ZC3H11B (1q41), LINC00340 (6p22.3), HERC2/OCA2 (15q13.1) and NPLOC4/TSPAN10 (17q25.3). Three of these loci also demonstrated genome-wide significant association with refractive astigmatism: LINC00340, HERC2/OCA2 and NPLOC4/TSPAN10. The genetic correlation between corneal and refractive astigmatism was 0.85 (standard error = 0.068, P = 1.37 × 10(-35)). Here, we have undertaken the largest genome-wide association studies for corneal and refractive astigmatism to date and identified four novel loci for corneal astigmatism, two of which were also novel loci for refractive astigmatism. These loci have previously demonstrated association with axial length (ZC3H11B), myopia (NPLOC4), spherical equivalent refractive error (LINC00340) and eye colour (HERC2). The shared role of these novel candidate genes for astigmatism lends further support to the shared genetic susceptibility of myopia and astigmatism.	
30305637	Two high-risk susceptibility loci at 6p25.3 and 14q32.13 for Waldenström macroglobulinemia.	Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM)/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) is a rare, chronic B-cell lymphoma with high heritability. We conduct a two-stage genome-wide association study of WM/LPL in 530 unrelated cases and 4362 controls of European ancestry and identify two high-risk loci associated with WM/LPL at 6p25.3 (rs116446171, near EXOC2 and IRF4; OR = 21.14, 95% CI: 14.40-31.03, P = 1.36 × 10(-54)) and 14q32.13 (rs117410836, near TCL1; OR = 4.90, 95% CI: 3.45-6.96, P = 8.75 × 10(-19)). Both risk alleles are observed at a low frequency among controls (~2-3%) and occur in excess in affected cases within families. In silico data suggest that rs116446171 may have functional importance, and in functional studies, we demonstrate increased reporter transcription and proliferation in cells transduced with the 6p25.3 risk allele. Although further studies are needed to fully elucidate underlying biological mechanisms, together these loci explain 4% of the familial risk and provide insights into genetic susceptibility to this malignancy.	
30305740	Genome-wide association studies of brain imaging phenotypes in UK Biobank.	The genetic architecture of brain structure and function is largely unknown. To investigate this, we carried out genome-wide association studies of 3,144 functional and structural brain imaging phenotypes from UK Biobank (discovery dataset 8,428 subjects). Here we show that many of these phenotypes are heritable. We identify 148 clusters of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and imaging phenotypes that replicate at P < 0.05, when we would expect 21 to replicate by chance. Notable significant, interpretable associations include: iron transport and storage genes, related to magnetic susceptibility of subcortical brain tissue; extracellular matrix and epidermal growth factor genes, associated with white matter micro-structure and lesions; genes that regulate mid-line axon development, associated with organization of the pontine crossing tract; and overall 17 genes involved in development, pathway signalling and plasticity. Our results provide insights into the genetic architecture of the brain that are relevant to neurological and psychiatric disorders, brain development and ageing.	
30315195	Discovering Genetic Factors for psoriasis through exhaustively searching for significant second order SNP-SNP interactions.	In this paper, we aim at discovering genetic factors of psoriasis through searching for statistically significant SNP-SNP interactions exhaustively from two real psoriasis genome-wide association study datasets (phs000019.v1.p1 and phs000982.v1.p1) downloaded from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. To deal with the enormous search space, our search algorithm is accelerated with eight biological plausible interaction patterns and a pre-computed look-up table. After our search, we have discovered several SNPs having a stronger association to psoriasis when they are in combination with another SNP and these combinations may be non-linear interactions. Among the top 20 SNP-SNP interactions being found in terms of pairwise p-value and improvement metric value, we have discovered 27 novel potential psoriasis-associated SNPs where most of them are reported to be eQTLs of a number of known psoriasis-associated genes. On the other hand, we have inferred a gene network after selecting the top 10000 SNP-SNP interactions in terms of improvement metric value and we have discovered a novel long distance interaction between XXbac-BPG154L12.4 and RNU6-283P which is not a long distance haplotype and may be a new discovery. Finally, our experiments with the synthetic datasets have shown that our pre-computed look-up table technique can significantly speed up the search process.	
30317457	Genome-wide association study of primary open-angle glaucoma in continental and admixed African populations.	Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a complex disease with a major genetic contribution. Its prevalence varies greatly among ethnic groups, and is up to five times more frequent in black African populations compared to Europeans. So far, worldwide efforts to elucidate the genetic complexity of POAG in African populations has been limited. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 1113 POAG cases and 1826 controls from Tanzanian, South African and African American study samples. Apart from confirming evidence of association at TXNRD2 (rs16984299; OR([T]) 1.20; P = 0.003), we found that a genetic risk score combining the effects of the 15 previously reported POAG loci was significantly associated with POAG in our samples (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.26-1.93; P = 4.79 × 10(-5)). By genome-wide association testing we identified a novel candidate locus, rs141186647, harboring EXOC4 (OR([A]) 0.48; P = 3.75 × 10(-8)), a gene transcribing a component of the exocyst complex involved in vesicle transport. The low frequency and high degree of genetic heterogeneity at this region hampered validation of this finding in predominantly West-African replication sets. Our results suggest that established genetic risk factors play a role in African POAG, however, they do not explain the higher disease load. The high heterogeneity within Africans remains a challenge to identify the genetic commonalities for POAG in this ethnicity, and demands studies of extremely large size.	
30323354	BRCA1/2-negative, high-risk breast cancers (BRCAX) for Asian women: genetic susceptibility loci and their potential impacts.	"BRCAX" refers breast cancers occurring in women with a family history predictive of being a BRCA1/2 mutation carrier, but BRCA1/2 genetic screening has failed to find causal mutations. In this study, we report the findings of the genetic architecture of BRCAX with novel and redefined candidate loci and their potential impacts on preventive strategy. We performed a genome-wide association study involving 1,469 BRCAX cases from the Korean Hereditary Breast Cancer study, and high-risk breast cancer cases (1,482 Asians and 9,902 Europeans) from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We also evaluated the previously reported susceptibility loci for their roles in the high-risk breast cancers. We have identified three novel loci (PDE7B, UBL3, and a new independent marker in CDKN2B-AS1) associated with BRCAX, and replicated previously reported SNPs (24 of 92) and moderate/high-penetrance (seven of 23) genes for Korean BRCAX. For the novel candidate loci, evidence supported their roles in regulatory function. We estimated that the common low-penetrance loci might explain a substantial part of high-risk breast cancer (39.4% for Koreans and 24.0% for Europeans). Our study findings suggest that common genetic markers with lower penetrance constitute a part of susceptibility to high-risk breast cancers, with potential implications for a more comprehensive genetic screening test.	
30320955	Identification of Novel Loci Associated With Hip Shape: A Meta-Analysis of Genomewide Association Studies.	We aimed to report the first genomewide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived hip shape, which is thought to be related to the risk of both hip osteoarthritis and hip fracture. Ten hip shape modes (HSMs) were derived by statistical shape modeling using SHAPE software, from hip DXA scans in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; adult females), TwinsUK (mixed sex), Framingham Osteoporosis Study (FOS; mixed), Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study (MrOS), and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF; females) (total N = 15,934). Associations were adjusted for age, sex, and ancestry. Five genomewide significant (p < 5 × 10(-9) , adjusted for 10 independent outcomes) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with HSM1, and three SNPs with HSM2. One SNP, in high linkage disequilibrium with rs2158915 associated with HSM1, was associated with HSM5 at genomewide significance. In a look-up of previous GWASs, three of the identified SNPs were associated with hip osteoarthritis, one with hip fracture, and five with height. Seven SNPs were within 200 kb of genes involved in endochondral bone formation, namely SOX9, PTHrP, RUNX1, NKX3-2, FGFR4, DICER1, and HHIP. The SNP adjacent to DICER1 also showed osteoblast cis-regulatory activity of GSC, in which mutations have previously been reported to cause hip dysplasia. For three of the lead SNPs, SNPs in high LD (r(2)  > 0.5) were identified, which intersected with open chromatin sites as detected by ATAC-seq performed on embryonic mouse proximal femora. In conclusion, we identified eight SNPs independently associated with hip shape, most of which were associated with height and/or mapped close to endochondral bone formation genes, consistent with a contribution of processes involved in limb growth to hip shape and pathological sequelae. These findings raise the possibility that genetic studies of hip shape might help in understanding potential pathways involved in hip osteoarthritis and hip fracture. © 2018 The Authors.

30326835	Genetic variants in nuclear DNA along with environmental factors modify mitochondrial DNA copy number: a population-based exome-wide association study.	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number has been found associated with multiple diseases, including cancers, diabetes and so on. Both environmental and genetic factors could affect the copy number of mtDNA. However, limited study was available about the relationship between genetic variants and mtDNA copy number. What's more, most of previous studies considered only environmental or genetic factors. Therefore, it's necessary to explore the genetic effects on mtDNA copy number with the consideration of PM(2.5) exposure and smoking. A multi-center population-based study was performed with 301 subjects from Zhuhai, Wuhan and Tianjin. Personal 24-h PM(2.5) exposure levels, smoking and mtDNA copy number were evaluated. The Illumina Human Exome BeadChip, which contained 241,305 single nucleotide variants, was used for genotyping. The association analysis was conducted in each city and meta-analysis was adopted to combine the overall effect among three cities. Seven SNPs showed significant association with mtDNA copy number with P value less than 1.00E-04 after meta-analysis. The following joint analysis of our identified SNPs showed a significant allele-dosage association between the number of variants and mtDNA copy number (P = 5.02 × 10(- 17)). Further, 11 genes were identified associated with mtDNA copy number using gene-based analysis with a P value less than 0.01. This study was the first attempt to evaluate the genetic effects on mtDNA copy number with the consideration of personal PM(2.5) exposure level. Our findings could provide more evidences that genetic variants played important roles in modulating the copy number of mtDNA.	
30325047	Identification and Replication of Six Loci Associated With Gallstone Disease.	Gallstone disease is a common complex disease that confers a substantial economic burden on society. The genetic underpinnings of gallstone disease remain incompletely understood. We aimed to identify genetic associations with gallstone disease using publicly available data from the UK Biobank and two large Danish cohorts. We extracted genetic associations with gallstone disease from the Global Biobank Engine (GBE), an online browser of genome-wide associations in UK Biobank participants (14,940 cases and 322,268 controls). Significant associations (P < 5 × 10(-8) ) were retested in two Copenhagen cohorts (comprising 1,522 cases and 18,266 controls). In the Copenhagen cohorts, we also tested whether a genetic risk score was associated with gallstone disease and whether individual gallstone loci were associated with plasma levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and liver enzymes. We identified 19 loci to be associated with gallstone disease in the GBE. Of these, 12 were replicated in the Copenhagen cohorts, including six previously unknown loci (in hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha [HNF4A], fucosyltransferase 2, serpin family A member 1 [SERPINA1], jumonji domain containing 1C, AC074212.3, and solute carrier family 10A member 2 [SLC10A2]) and six known loci (in adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily G member 8 [ABCG8], sulfotransferase family 2A member 1, cytochrome P450 7A1, transmembrane 4 L six family member 4, ABCB4, and tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39B). Five of the gallstone associations are protein-altering variants, and three (HNF4A p.Thr139Ile, SERPINA1 p.Glu366Lys, and SLC10A2 p.Pro290Ser) conferred per-allele odds ratios for gallstone disease of 1.30-1.36. Individuals with a genetic risk score >2.5 (prevalence 1%) had a 5-fold increased risk of gallstones compared to those with a score <1.0 (11%). Of the 19 lithogenic loci, 11 and ten exhibited distinct patterns of association with plasma levels of lipids and liver enzymes, respectively. Conclusion: We identified six susceptibility loci for gallstone disease.	
30327367	Genome-Wide Meta-analysis of Gene-Environmental Interaction for Insulin Resistance Phenotypes and Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Women.	Insulin resistance (IR)-related genetic variants are possibly associated with breast cancer, and the gene-phenotype-cancer association could be modified by lifestyle factors including obesity, physical inactivity, and high-fat diet. Using data from postmenopausal women, a population highly susceptible to obesity, IR, and increased risk of breast cancer, we implemented a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two steps: (1) GWAS meta-analysis of gene-environmental (i.e., behavioral) interaction (G*E) for IR phenotypes (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance) and (2) after the G*E GWAS meta-analysis, the identified SNPs were tested for their associations with breast cancer risk in overall or subgroup population, where the SNPs were identified at genome-wide significance. We found 58 loci (55 novel SNPs; 5 index SNPs and 6 SNPs, independent of each other) that are associated with IR phenotypes in women overall or women stratified by obesity, physical activity, and high-fat diet; among those 58 loci, 29 (26 new loci; 2 index SNPs and 2 SNPs, independently) were associated with postmenopausal breast cancer. Our study suggests that a number of newly identified SNPs may have their effects on glucose intolerance by interplaying with obesity and other lifestyle factors, and a substantial proportion of these SNPs' susceptibility can also interact with the lifestyle factors to ultimately influence breast cancer risk. These findings may contribute to improved prediction accuracy for cancer and suggest potential intervention strategies for those women carrying genetic risk that will reduce their breast cancer risk.	
30336701	Genome-Wide Association Study Meta-Analysis of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) in Two Population-Based Cohorts.	Alcohol use disorders are common conditions that have enormous social and economic consequences. Genome-wide association analyses were performed to identify genetic variants associated with a proxy measure of alcohol consumption and alcohol misuse and to explore the shared genetic basis between these measures and other substance use, psychiatric, and behavioral traits. This study used quantitative measures from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) from two population-based cohorts of European ancestry (UK Biobank [N=121,604] and 23andMe [N=20,328]) and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Two additional GWAS analyses were performed, a GWAS for AUDIT scores on items 1-3, which focus on consumption (AUDIT-C), and for scores on items 4-10, which focus on the problematic consequences of drinking (AUDIT-P). The GWAS meta-analysis of AUDIT total score identified 10 associated risk loci. Novel associations localized to genes including JCAD and SLC39A13; this study also replicated previously identified signals in the genes ADH1B, ADH1C, KLB, and GCKR. The dimensions of AUDIT showed positive genetic correlations with alcohol consumption (r(g)=0.76-0.92) and DSM-IV alcohol dependence (r(g)=0.33-0.63). AUDIT-P and AUDIT-C scores showed significantly different patterns of association across a number of traits, including psychiatric disorders. AUDIT-P score was significantly positively genetically correlated with schizophrenia (r(g)=0.22), major depressive disorder (r(g)=0.26), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (r(g)=0.23), whereas AUDIT-C score was significantly negatively genetically correlated with major depressive disorder (r(g)=-0.24) and ADHD (r(g)=-0.10). This study also used the AUDIT data in the UK Biobank to identify thresholds for dichotomizing AUDIT total score that optimize genetic correlations with DSM-IV alcohol dependence. Coding individuals with AUDIT total scores ≤4 as control subjects and those with scores ≥12 as case subjects produced a significant high genetic correlation with DSM-IV alcohol dependence (r(g)=0.82) while retaining most subjects. AUDIT scores ascertained in population-based cohorts can be used to explore the genetic basis of both alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders.	
30339177	The 677C→T variant of MTHFR is the major genetic modifier of biomarkers of folate status in a young, healthy Irish population.	Genetic polymorphisms can explain some of the population- and individual-based variations in nutritional status biomarkers. We sought to screen the entire human genome for common genetic polymorphisms that influence folate-status biomarkers in healthy individuals. We carried out candidate gene analyses and genome-wide association scans in 2232 young, healthy Irish subjects to evaluate which common genetic polymorphisms influence red blood cell folate, serum folate, and plasma total homocysteine. The 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C→T (rs1801133) variant was the major genetic modifier of all 3 folate-related biomarkers in this Irish population and reached genome-wide significance for red blood cell folate (P = 1.37 × 10-17), serum folate (P = 2.82 × 10-11), and plasma total homocysteine (P = 1.26 × 10-19) concentrations. A second polymorphism in the MTHFR gene (rs3753584, P = 1.09 × 10-11) was the only additional MTHFR variant to exhibit any significant independent effect on red blood cell folate. Other MTHFR variants, including the 1298A→C variant (rs1801131), appeared to reach genome-wide significance, but these variants shared linkage disequilibrium with MTHFR 677C→T and were not significant when analyzed in MTHFR 677CC homozygotes. No additional non-MTHFR modifiers of red blood cell or plasma folate were detected. Two additional genome-wide significant modifiers of plasma homocysteine were found in the region of the dipeptidase 1 (DPEP1) gene on chromosome 16 and the Twist neighbor B (TWISTNB) gene on chromosome 7. The MTHFR 677C→T variant is the predominant genetic modifier of folate status biomarkers in this healthy Irish population. It is not necessary to determine MTHFR 677C→T genotype to evaluate folate status because its effect is reflected in concentrations of standard folate biomarkers. The MTHFR 1298A→C variant had no independent effect on folate status biomarkers. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide association study report on red blood cell folate and the first report of an association between homocysteine and TWISTNB.	
30343302	High Genetic Risk Scores of ASIC2, MACROD2, CHRM3, and C2orf83 Genetic Variants Associated with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Impair Insulin Sensitivity and Interact with Energy Intake in Korean Women.	We explored the genetic variants that were associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by genome-wide association study (GWAS) and evaluated the association of genetic risk scores (GRS) of the selected genetic variants with insulin resistance and the interaction of the GRS with nutrient intake to develop insulin resistance. The 6 genetic variants involved in brain and nervous system (acid sensing ion channel subunit 2 rs8071961, rs1988598, and rs16589, macro domain containing 2 rs7262810 CHRM3 rs1867265 and chromosome 2 open reading frame 83 rs11889798) were selected from a GWAS of the PCOS study. GRS of the 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms was calculated in 3,723 Korean women in the Ansan/Ansung cohort of KARE study. Fasting serum insulin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and psychological stress levels were significantly higher in the high-GRS group than the low-GRS group. However, serum-free T4 levels were significantly lower in the high-GRS group. HOMA-IR and CRP were higher OR (1.129 and 1.382) in the high-GRS group than the low-GRS group after adjusted for covariates. There was a significant interaction between GRS and daily energy intake (p = 0.004). The OR (1.233) for HOMA-IR was higher in the high-GRS group than the low-GRS group only in the group with lower energy intakes based on estimated energy requirement. Women with high-GRS for PCOS had increased risk of insulin resistance and low energy intake did not protect against the elevation of insulin resistance in women with high GRS. Low energy intake might be protective against PCOS in carriers with low and medium GRS.	
30348214	Genotype effects contribute to variation in longitudinal methylome patterns in older people.	DNA methylation levels change along with age, but few studies have examined the variation in the rate of such changes between individuals. We performed a longitudinal analysis to quantify the variation in the rate of change of DNA methylation between individuals using whole blood DNA methylation array profiles collected at 2-4 time points (N = 2894) in 954 individuals (67-90 years). After stringent quality control, we identified 1507 DNA methylation CpG sites (rsCpGs) with statistically significant variation in the rate of change (random slope) of DNA methylation among individuals in a mixed linear model analysis. Genes in the vicinity of these rsCpGs were found to be enriched in Homeobox transcription factors and the Wnt signalling pathway, both of which are related to ageing processes. Furthermore, we investigated the SNP effect on the random slope. We found that 4 out of 1507 rsCpGs had one significant (P < 5 × 10(-8)/1507) SNP effect and 343 rsCpGs had at least one SNP effect (436 SNP-probe pairs) reaching genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Ninety-five percent of the significant (P < 5 × 10(-8)) SNPs are on different chromosomes from their corresponding probes. We identified CpG sites that have variability in the rate of change of DNA methylation between individuals, and our results suggest a genetic basis of this variation. Genes around these CpG sites have been reported to be involved in the ageing process.	
30353303	Genomics and response to long-term oxygen therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death worldwide, and long-term oxygen therapy has been shown to reduce mortality in COPD patients with severe hypoxemia. However, the Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT), a large randomized trial, found no benefit of oxygen therapy in COPD patients with moderate hypoxemia. We hypothesized that there may be differences in response to oxygen which depend on genotype or gene expression. In a genome-wide time-to-event analysis of the primary outcome of death or hospitalization in 331 subjects, 97 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed evidence of interaction with oxygen therapy at P < 1e-5, including 7 SNPs near arylsulfatase B (ARSB; P = 6e-6). In microarray expression profiling on 51 whole blood samples from 37 individuals, at screening and/or at 12-month follow-up, ARSB expression was associated with the primary outcome depending on oxygen treatment. The significant SNPs were conditional expression quantitative trait loci for ARSB expression. In a network analysis of genes affected by long-term oxygen, two observed clusters including 26 co-expressed genes were enriched in mitochondrial function. Using data from the observational COPDGene Study, we validated the expression of 25 of these 26 genes, plus ARSB. The effect of long-term oxygen therapy in COPD varied based on ARSB expression and genotype. ARSB has previously been shown to be associated with hypoxemia in human bronchial and colonic epithelial cells and in a mouse model. In peripheral blood, long-term oxygen treatment affected expression of mitochondrial-related genes, a biologically relevant pathway in COPD. SNPs and expression of ARSB are associated with response to long-term oxygen in COPD. The ARSB SNPs were expression quantitative trait loci depending on oxygen therapy. Genes differentially expressed by long-term oxygen were enriched in mitochondrial functions. This suggests a potential biomarker to personalize use of long-term oxygen in COPD.	
30361487	Genome-wide association study of brain amyloid deposition as measured by Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB)-PET imaging.	Deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain is one of the two main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is a neuroimaging tool that selectively detects in vivo amyloid deposition in the brain and is a reliable endophenotype for AD that complements cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers with regional information. We measured in vivo amyloid deposition in the brains of ~1000 subjects from three collaborative AD centers and ADNI using(11)C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB)-PET imaging followed by meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies, first to our knowledge for PiB-PET, to identify novel genetic loci for this endophenotype. The APOE region showed the most significant association where several SNPs surpassed the genome-wide significant threshold, with APOE*4 being most significant (P-meta = 9.09E-30; β = 0.18). Interestingly, after conditioning on APOE*4, 14 SNPs remained significant at P < 0.05 in the APOE region that were not in linkage disequilibrium with APOE*4. Outside the APOE region, the meta-analysis revealed 15 non-APOE loci with P < 1E-05 on nine chromosomes, with two most significant SNPs on chromosomes 8 (P-meta = 4.87E-07) and 3 (P-meta = 9.69E-07). Functional analyses of these SNPs indicate their potential relevance with AD pathogenesis. Top 15 non-APOE SNPs along with APOE*4 explained 25-35% of the amyloid variance in different datasets, of which 14-17% was explained by APOE*4 alone. In conclusion, we have identified novel signals in APOE and non-APOE regions that affect amyloid deposition in the brain. Our data also highlights the presence of yet to be discovered variants that may be responsible for the unexplained genetic variance of amyloid deposition.	
30367059	Genome-wide analyses identify a role for SLC17A4 and AADAT in thyroid hormone regulation.	Thyroid dysfunction is an important public health problem, which affects 10% of the general population and increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of thyroid hormone regulation have only partly been elucidated, including its transport, metabolism, and genetic determinants. Here we report a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for thyroid function and dysfunction, testing 8 million genetic variants in up to 72,167 individuals. One-hundred-and-nine independent genetic variants are associated with these traits. A genetic risk score, calculated to assess their combined effects on clinical end points, shows significant associations with increased risk of both overt (Graves' disease) and subclinical thyroid disease, as well as clinical complications. By functional follow-up on selected signals, we identify a novel thyroid hormone transporter (SLC17A4) and a metabolizing enzyme (AADAT). Together, these results provide new knowledge about thyroid hormone physiology and disease, opening new possibilities for therapeutic targets.	
30374069	Meta-analysis of Icelandic and UK data sets identifies missense variants in SMO, IL11, COL11A1 and 13 more new loci associated with osteoarthritis.	Osteoarthritis has a highly negative impact on quality of life because of the associated pain and loss of joint function. Here we describe the largest meta-analysis so far of osteoarthritis of the hip and the knee in samples from Iceland and the UK Biobank (including 17,151 hip osteoarthritis patients, 23,877 knee osteoarthritis patients, and more than 562,000 controls). We found 23 independent associations at 22 loci in the additive meta-analyses, of which 16 of the loci were novel: 12 for hip and 4 for knee osteoarthritis. Two associations are between rare or low-frequency missense variants and hip osteoarthritis, affecting the genes SMO (rs143083812, frequency 0.11%, odds ratio (OR) = 2.8, P = 7.9 × 10(-12), p.Arg173Cys) and IL11 (rs4252548, frequency 2.08%, OR = 1.30, P = 2.1 × 10(-11), p.Arg112His). A common missense variant in the COL11A1 gene also associates with hip osteoarthritis (rs3753841, frequency 61%, P = 5.2 × 10(-10), OR = 1.08, p.Pro1284Leu). In addition, using a recessive model, we confirm an association between hip osteoarthritis and a variant of CHADL(1) (rs117018441, P = 1.8 × 10(-25), OR = 5.9). Furthermore, we observe a complex relationship between height and risk of osteoarthritis.	
30373671	Childhood asthma is associated with COPD and known asthma variants in COPDGene: a genome-wide association study.	Childhood asthma is strongly influenced by genetics and is a risk factor for reduced lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. This study investigates self-reported childhood asthma in adult smokers from the COPDGene Study. We hypothesize that childhood asthma is associated with decreased lung function, increased risk for COPD, and that a genome-wide association study (GWAS) will show association with established asthma variants. We evaluated current and former smokers ages 45-80 of non-Hispanic white (NHW) or African American (AA) race. Childhood asthma was defined by self-report of asthma, diagnosed by a medical professional, with onset at < 16 years or during childhood. Subjects with a history of childhood asthma were compared to those who never had asthma based on lung function, development of COPD, and genetic variation. GWAS was performed in NHW and AA populations, and combined in meta-analysis. Two sets of established asthma SNPs from published literature were examined for association with childhood asthma. Among 10,199 adult smokers, 730 (7%) reported childhood asthma and 7493 (73%) reported no history of asthma. Childhood asthmatics had reduced lung function and increased risk for COPD (OR 3.42, 95% CI 2.81-4.18). Genotype data was assessed for 8031 subjects. Among NHWs, 391(7%) had childhood asthma, and GWAS identified one genome-wide significant association in KIAA1958 (rs59289606, p = 4.82 × 10(- 8)). Among AAs, 339 (12%) had childhood asthma. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the AAs or in the meta-analysis combining NHW and AA subjects; however, potential regions of interest were identified. Established asthma SNPs were examined, seven from the NHGRI-EBI database and five with genome-wide significance in the largest pediatric asthma GWAS. Associations were found in the current childhood asthma GWAS with known asthma loci in IL1RL1, IL13, LINC01149, near GSDMB, and in the C11orf30-LRRC32 region (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Childhood asthmatics are at increased risk for COPD. Defining asthma by self-report is valid in populations at risk for COPD, identifying subjects with clinical and genetic characteristics known to associate with childhood asthma. This has potential to improve clinical understanding of asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) and enhance future research into ACO-specific treatment regimens. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00608764 (Active since January 28, 2008).	
30377885	Bactericidal/Permeability-Increasing Fold-Containing Family B Member 4 May Be Associated with NSAID-Induced Enteropathy.	There is considerable individual variability in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced enteropathy. To identify the SNP that is most significantly involved with NSAID-induced enteropathy. One hundred fifty human subjects who were known to have a certain degree of loxoprofen- or celecoxib-induced small-intestinal damage from a previous study were enrolled. The subjects were divided into groups based on treatments and also on the increased number of small intestinal mucosal breaks. The candidate SNP was selected by an initial analysis of GWAS among the groups in various combinations. After the initial analysis, the gene including the specified SNP was analyzed in detail using GWAS and genotype imputation. After analysis, 70 subjects receiving the loxoprofen treatment and 69 subjects receiving celecoxib treatment were determined to be eligible for the analysis. The minimum p value in GWAS was detected in the analysis of 16 cases with an increase of five or more mucosal breaks and 123 controls with zero to four mucosal breaks. In the GWAS, five SNPs in the bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold-containing family B member 4 (BPIFB4) gene showed the lowest p value (p = 2.69 × 10(-7) with an odds ratio of 40.9). Of the five SNPs, four were nonsynonymous SNPs (rs2070325: V268I, rs2889732: T320N, rs11699009: F527L, rs11696307: T533I, and rs11696310: intronic). Furthermore, 23 SNPs in BPIFB4 detected by genotype imputation based on the GWAS data also showed suggestive associations (p < 1 × 10(-6)). The results indicate that SNPs in BPIFB4 were associated with NSAID-induced small intestinal mucosal injury (UMIN: 000007936).	
30378284	Moderating effect of mode of delivery on the genetics of intelligence: Explorative genome-wide analyses in ALSPAC.	Intelligence is a core construct of individual differences in cognitive abilities and a strong predictor of important life outcomes. Within recent years, rates of cesarean section have substantially increased globally, though little is known about its effect on neurodevelopmental trajectories. Thus, we aimed to investigate the influence of delivery by cesarean section on the genetics of intelligence in children. Participants were recruited through the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Intelligence was measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human Hap 550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping platform and was followed by imputation using MACH software. Genome-wide interaction analyses were conducted using linear regression. A total of 2,421 children and 2,141,747 SNPs were subjected to the genome-wide interaction analyses. No variant reached genome-wide significance. The strongest interaction was observed at rs17800861 in the GRIN2A gene (β = -3.43, 95% CI = -4.74 to -2.12, p = 2.98E-07). This variant is predicted to be located within active chromatin compartments in the hippocampus and may influence binding of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Our results may indicate that mode of delivery might have a moderating effect on genetic disposition of intelligence in children. Studies of considerable sizes (>10,000) are likely required to more robustly detect variants governing such interaction. In summary, the presented findings prompt the need for further studies aimed at increasing our understanding of effects various modes of delivery may have on health outcomes in children.	
30388399	Genome Analyses of >200,000 Individuals Identify 58 Loci for Chronic Inflammation and Highlight Pathways that Link Inflammation and Complex Disorders.	C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive biomarker of chronic low-grade inflammation and is associated with multiple complex diseases. The genetic determinants of chronic inflammation remain largely unknown, and the causal role of CRP in several clinical outcomes is debated. We performed two genome-wide association studies (GWASs), on HapMap and 1000 Genomes imputed data, of circulating amounts of CRP by using data from 88 studies comprising 204,402 European individuals. Additionally, we performed in silico functional analyses and Mendelian randomization analyses with several clinical outcomes. The GWAS meta-analyses of CRP revealed 58 distinct genetic loci (p < 5 × 10(-8)). After adjustment for body mass index in the regression analysis, the associations at all except three loci remained. The lead variants at the distinct loci explained up to 7.0% of the variance in circulating amounts of CRP. We identified 66 gene sets that were organized in two substantially correlated clusters, one mainly composed of immune pathways and the other characterized by metabolic pathways in the liver. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed a causal protective effect of CRP on schizophrenia and a risk-increasing effect on bipolar disorder. Our findings provide further insights into the biology of inflammation and could lead to interventions for treating inflammation and its clinical consequences.	
30480742	Genome-Wide Association Study to Identify a New Susceptibility Locus for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy in the Japanese Population.	Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a retinal disorder that often affects the vision of middle-aged people yet the molecular mechanisms of CSC remain unknown. This study was conducted to identify genetic factors influencing individual differences in susceptibility to CSC. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted with a total of 320 unrelated Japanese idiopathic CSC cases and 3245 population-based controls. In a discovery stage, 137 unrelated Japanese idiopathic CSC cases and 1174 population-based controls were subjected to GWAS, followed by a replication study using an additional 183 individuals with idiopathic CSC and 2071 population-based volunteers. The results of the discovery and replication stages were combined to conduct a meta-analysis. In the two-stage GWAS, rs11865049 located at SLC7A5 in chromosome 16q24.2 was identified as a novel disease susceptibility locus for CSC, as evident from the discovery and replication results using meta-analysis (combined P = 9.71 × 10-9, odds ratio = 2.10). The results of the present study demonstrated that SLC7A5 might be the potential candidate gene associated with CSC, indicating a previously unidentified molecular mechanism of CSC.	
30383316	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 3 novel loci associated with stroke.	We conducted a European-only and transancestral genome-wide association meta-analysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in NOS3 (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; p = 2.2E-8, odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.07) and variants in an intron of COL4A1 (rs9521634; p = 3.8E-8, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03-1.06) and near DYRK1A (rs720470; p = 6.1E-9, OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03-1.07) at genome-wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian randomization, we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure. Ann Neurol 2018;84:934-939.	
30395268	Genome-wide meta-analysis and replication studies in multiple ethnicities identify novel adolescent idiopathic scoliosis susceptibility loci.	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder of childhood development. The genetic architecture of AIS is complex, and the great majority of risk factors are undiscovered. To identify new AIS susceptibility loci, we conducted the first genome-wide meta-analysis of AIS genome-wide association studies, including 7956 cases and 88 459 controls from 3 ancestral groups. Three novel loci that surpassed genome-wide significance were uncovered in intragenic regions of the CDH13 (P-value_rs4513093 = 1.7E-15), ABO (P-value_ rs687621 = 7.3E-10) and SOX6 (P-value_rs1455114 = 2.98E-08) genes. Restricting the analysis to females improved the associations at multiple loci, most notably with variants within CDH13 despite the reduction in sample size. Genome-wide gene-functional enrichment analysis identified significant perturbation of pathways involving cartilage and connective tissue development. Expression of both SOX6 and CDH13 was detected in cartilage chondrocytes and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments in that tissue revealed multiple HeK27ac-positive peaks overlapping associated loci. Our results further define the genetic architecture of AIS and highlight the importance of vertebral cartilage development in its pathogenesis.	
30596066	Genome-wide association study identifies 	Fluorodeoxyglucose f18 positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) is regarded as the only functional neuroimaging biomarker for degeneration which can be used to increase the certainty of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiological process in research settings or as an optional clinical tool where available. Although a decline in FDG metabolism was confirmed in some regions known to be associated with AD, there was little known about the genetic association of FDG metabolism in AD cohorts. In this study, we present the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of brain FDG metabolism. A total of 222 individuals were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort. All subjects were restricted to non-Hispanic Caucasians and met all quality control (QC) criteria. Associations of 18F-FDG with the genetic variants were assessed using PLINK 1.07 under the additive genetic model. Genome-wide associations were visualized using a software program R 3.2.3. One significant SNP rs12444565 in RNA-binding Fox1 ((RBFOX1)) was found to have a strong association with 18F-FDG (P=6.06×10(-8)). Rs235141, rs79037, rs12526331 and rs12529764 were identified as four suggestive loci associated with 18F-FDG. Our study results suggest that a genome-wide significant SNP (rs12444565) in the(RBFOX1), and four suggestive loci (rs235141, rs79037, rs12526331 and rs12529764) are associated with 18F-FDG.	
30382898	Multiple genotype-phenotype association study reveals intronic variant pair on SIDT2 associated with metabolic syndrome in a Korean population.	Metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We identified common genetic variants that alter the risk for metabolic syndrome in the Korean population. To isolate these variants, we conducted a multiple-genotype and multiple-phenotype genome-wide association analysis using the family-based quasi-likelihood score (MFQLS) test. For this analysis, we used 7211 and 2838 genotyped study subjects for discovery and replication, respectively. We also performed a multiple-genotype and multiple-phenotype analysis of a gene-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set. We found an association between metabolic syndrome and an intronic SNP pair, rs7107152 and rs1242229, in SIDT2 gene at 11q23.3. Both SNPs correlate with the expression of SIDT2 and TAGLN, whose products promote insulin secretion and lipid metabolism, respectively. This SNP pair showed statistical significance at the replication stage. Our findings provide insight into an underlying mechanism that contributes to metabolic syndrome.	
30392061	Genetic association and differential expression of PITX2 with acute appendicitis.	Appendicitis affects 9% of Americans and is the most common diagnosis requiring hospitalization of both children and adults. We performed a genome-wide association study of self-reported appendectomy with 18,773 affected adults and 114,907 unaffected adults of European American ancestry. A significant association with appendectomy was observed at 4q25 near the gene PITX2 (rs2129979, p value = 8.82 × 10(-14)) and was replicated in an independent sample of Caucasians (59 affected, 607 unaffected; p value = 0.005). Meta-analysis of the associated variant across our two cohorts and cohorts from Iceland and the Netherlands (in which this association had previously been reported) showed strong cumulative evidence of association (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.09-1.14; p value = 1.81 × 10(-23)) and some evidence for effect heterogeneity (p value = 0.03). Eight other loci were identified at suggestive significance in the discovery GWAS. Associations were followed up by measuring gene expression across resected appendices with varying levels of inflammation (N = 75). We measured expression of 27 genes based on physical proximity to the GWAS signals, evidence of being targeted by eQTLs near the signals according to RegulomeDB (score = 1), or both. Four of the 27 genes (including PITX2) showed significant evidence (p values < 0.0033) of differential expression across categories of appendix inflammation. An additional ten genes showed nominal evidence (p value < 0.05) of differential expression, which, together with the significant genes, is more than expected by chance (p value = 6.6 × 10(-12)). PITX2 impacts morphological development of intestinal tissue, promotes an anti-oxidant response, and its expression correlates with levels of intestinal bacteria and colonic inflammation. Further studies of the role of PITX2 in appendicitis are warranted.	
30410027	Genome-wide associations for benign prostatic hyperplasia reveal a genetic correlation with serum levels of PSA.	Benign prostatic hyperplasia and associated lower urinary tract symptoms (BPH/LUTS) are common conditions affecting the majority of elderly males. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study of symptomatic BPH/LUTS in 20,621 patients and 280,541 controls of European ancestry, from Iceland and the UK. We discovered 23 genome-wide significant variants, located at 14 loci. There is little or no overlap between the BPH/LUTS variants and published prostate cancer risk variants. However, 15 of the variants reported here also associate with serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) (at a Bonferroni corrected P < 0.0022). Furthermore, there is a strong genetic correlation, r(g) = 0.77 (P = 2.6 × 10(-11)), between PSA and BPH/LUTS, and one standard deviation increase in a polygenic risk score (PRS) for BPH/LUTS increases PSA levels by 12.9% (P = 1.6×10(-55)). These results shed a light on the genetic background of BPH/LUTS and its substantial influence on PSA levels.	
30412241	Genome-wide association study of cervical cancer suggests a role for ARRDC3 gene in human papillomavirus infection.	The development of cervical cancer is initiated by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and involves both viral and host genetic factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cervical cancer have identified associations in the HLA locus and two loci outside HLA, but the principal genes that control infection and pathogenesis have not been identified. In the present study, we performed GWAS of cervical cancer in East Asian populations, involving 2609 cases and 4712 controls in the discovery stage and 1461 cases and 3295 controls in the follow-up stage. We identified novel-significant associations at 5q14 with the lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs59661306 (P = 2.4 × 10-11) and at 7p11 with the lead SNP rs7457728 (P = 1.2 × 10-8). In 5q14, the chromatin region of the GWAS-significant SNPs was found to be in contact with the promoter of the ARRDC3 (arrestin domain-containing 3) gene. In our functional studies, ARRDC3 knockdown in HeLa cells caused significant reductions in both cell growth and susceptibility to HPV16 pseudovirion infection, suggesting that ARRDC3 is involved in the infectious entry of HPV into the cell. Our study advances the understanding of host genes that are responsible for cervical cancer susceptibility and guides future research on HPV infection and cancer development.	
30431558	Genome-wide association reveals contribution of MRAS to painful temporomandibular disorder in males.	Painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are the leading cause of chronic orofacial pain, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Although many environmental factors have been associated with higher risk of developing painful TMD, family and twin studies support a heritable genetic component as well. We performed a genome-wide association study assuming an additive genetic model of TMD in a discovery cohort of 999 cases and 2031 TMD-free controls from the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study. Using logistic models adjusted for sex, age, enrollment site, and race, we identified 3 distinct loci that were significant in combined or sex-segregated analyses. A single-nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 3 (rs13078961) was significantly associated with TMD in males only (odds ratio = 2.9, 95% confidence interval: 2.02-4.27, P = 2.2 × 10). This association was nominally replicated in a meta-analysis of 7 independent orofacial pain cohorts including 160,194 participants (odds ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.0-1.35, P = 2.3 × 10). Functional analysis in human dorsal root ganglia and blood indicated this variant is an expression quantitative trait locus, with the minor allele associated with decreased expression of the nearby muscle RAS oncogene homolog (MRAS) gene (beta = -0.51, P = 2.43 × 10). Male mice, but not female mice, with a null mutation of Mras displayed persistent mechanical allodynia in a model of inflammatory pain. Genetic and behavioral evidence support a novel mechanism by which genetically determined MRAS expression moderates the resiliency to chronic pain. This effect is male-specific and may contribute to the lower rates of painful TMD in men.	
30423114	Genetic influences on susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in African-Americans.	Large meta-analyses of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility in European (EUR) and East Asian (EAS) populations have identified >100 RA risk loci, but genome-wide studies of RA in African-Americans (AAs) are absent. To address this disparity, we performed an analysis of 916 AA RA patients and 1392 controls and aggregated our data with genotyping data from >100 000 EUR and Asian RA patients and controls. We identified two novel risk loci that appear to be specific to AAs: GPC5 and RBFOX1 (PAA < 5 × 10-9). Most RA risk loci are shared across different ethnicities, but among discordant loci, we observed strong enrichment of variants having large effect sizes. We found strong evidence of effect concordance for only 3 of the 21 largest effect index variants in EURs. We used the trans-ethnic fine-mapping algorithm PAINTOR3 to prioritize risk variants in >90 RA risk loci. Addition of AA data to those of EUR and EAS descent enabled identification of seven novel high-confidence candidate pathogenic variants (defined by posterior probability > 0.8). In summary, our trans-ethnic analyses are the first to include AAs, identified several new RA risk loci and point to candidate pathogenic variants that may underlie this common autoimmune disease. These findings may lead to better ways to diagnose or stratify treatment approaches in RA.	
30429480	Novel pleiotropic risk loci for melanoma and nevus density implicate multiple biological pathways.	The total number of acquired melanocytic nevi on the skin is strongly correlated with melanoma risk. Here we report a meta-analysis of 11 nevus GWAS from Australia, Netherlands, UK, and USA comprising 52,506 individuals. We confirm known loci including MTAP, PLA2G6, and IRF4, and detect novel SNPs in KITLG and a region of 9q32. In a bivariate analysis combining the nevus results with a recent melanoma GWAS meta-analysis (12,874 cases, 23,203 controls), SNPs near GPRC5A, CYP1B1, PPARGC1B, HDAC4, FAM208B, DOCK8, and SYNE2 reached global significance, and other loci, including MIR146A and OBFC1, reached a suggestive level. Overall, we conclude that most nevus genes affect melanoma risk (KITLG an exception), while many melanoma risk loci do not alter nevus count. For example, variants in TERC and OBFC1 affect both traits, but other telomere length maintenance genes seem to affect melanoma risk only. Our findings implicate multiple pathways in nevogenesis.	
30498476	Heritability and Genome-Wide Association Study of Plasma Cholesterol in Chinese Adult Twins.	Dyslipidemia represents a strong and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Plasma cholesterol, such as total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), is the common indicator of diagnosing dyslipidemia. Here based on 382 Chinese twin pairs, we explored the magnitude of genetic impact on TC, HDL-C, LDL-C variation and further searched for genetic susceptibility loci for them using genome-wide association study (GWAS). The ACE model was the best fit model with additive genetic parameter (A) accounting for 26.6%, common or shared environmental parameter (C) accounting for 47.8%, unique/non-shared environmental parameter (E) accounting for 25.6% for the variance in HDL-C. The AE model was the best fit model for TC (A: 61.4%; E: 38.6%) and LDL-C (A: 65.5%; E: 34.5%). While no SNPs reached the genome-wide significance level ((P) < 5 × 10(-8)), 8, 14, 9 SNPs exceeded the suggestive significance level ((P) < 1 × 10(-5)) for TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, respectively. The promising genetic regions for TC, HDL-C, LDL-C were on chromosome 11 around rs7107698, chromosome 5 around rs12518218, chromosome 2 around rs10490120, respectively. Gene-based analysis found 1038, 1033 and 1090 genes nominally associated with TC, HDL-C, LDL-C ((P) < 0.05), especially(FAF1, KLKB1) for TC,(KLKB1) for HDL-C, and(NTRK1, FAF1, SNTB2) for LDL-C, respectively. The number of common related genes among TC, HDL-C and LDL-C was 71, including(FAF1, KLKB1), etc. Pathway enrichment analysis discovered known related pathways-zinc transporters, metal ion SLC transporters for TC, cell adhesion molecules CAMs, IL-6 signaling for HDL, FC epsilon RI signaling pathway, NFAT pathway for LDL, respectively. In conclusion, the TC and LDL-C level is moderately heritable and the HDL-C level is lowly heritable in Chinese population. The genomic loci, functional genes and pathways are identified to account for the heritability of plasma cholesterol level. Our findings provide important insights into plasma cholesterol molecular physiology and expect future research to replicate and validate our results.	
30453627	Genome-Wide Association Studies of Estimated Fatty Acid Desaturase Activity in Serum and Adipose Tissue in Elderly Individuals: Associations with Insulin Sensitivity.	Fatty acid desaturases (FADS) catalyze the formation of unsaturated fatty acids and have been related to insulin sensitivity (IS). FADS activities differ between tissues and are influenced by genetic factors that may impact the link to IS. Genome-wide association studies of δ-5-desaturase (D5D), δ-6-desaturase (D6D) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD) activities (estimated by product-to-precursor ratios of fatty acids analyzed by gas chromatography) in serum cholesterol esters ((n) = 1453) and adipose tissue ((n) = 783, all men) were performed in two Swedish population-based cohorts. Genome-wide significant associated loci were evaluated for associations with IS measured with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp ((n) = 554). Variants at the(FADS1) were strongly associated with D5D in both cholesterol esters ((p) = 1.9 × 10(-70)) and adipose tissue ((p) = 1.1 × 10(-27)). Variants in three further loci were associated with D6D in cholesterol esters ((FADS2),(p) = 3.0 × 10(-67);(PDXDCI),(p) = 4.8 × 10(-8); and near(MC4R),(p) = 3.7 × 10(-8)) but no associations with D6D in adipose tissue attained genome-wide significance. One locus was associated with SCD in adipose tissue ((PKDL1),(p) = 2.2 × 10(-19)). Genetic variants near(MC4R) were associated with IS ((p) = 3.8 × 10(-3)). The(FADS) cluster was the main genetic determinant of estimated FADS activity. However, fatty acid (FA) ratios in adipose tissue and cholesterol esters represent FADS activities in separate tissues and are thus influenced by different genetic factors with potential varying effects on IS.	
30450575	Genetic predisposition to PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity in children treated according to NOPHO ALL2008.	Asparaginase is essential in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treatment, however hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) hampers anti-neoplastic efficacy. Patients with PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity have been shown to possess zero asparaginase enzyme activity. Using this measurement to define the phenotype, we investigated genetic predisposition to PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). From July 2008 to March 2016, 1494 children were treated on the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol. Cases were defined by clinical hypersensitivity and no enzyme activity, controls had enzyme activity ≥ 100 iu/l and no hypersensitivity symptoms. PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity was reported in 13·8% (206/1494) of patients. Fifty-nine cases and 772 controls fulfilled GWAS inclusion criteria. The CNOT3 variant rs73062673 on 19q13.42, was associated with PEG-asparaginase allergy (P = 4·68 × 10(-8) ). We further identified two signals on chromosome 6 in relation to HLA-DQA1 (P = 9·37 × 10(-6) ) and TAP2 (P = 1·59 × 10(-5) ). This study associated variants in CNOT3 and in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region with PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity, suggesting that not only genetic variations in the HLA region, but also regulation of these genes are of importance in the biology of this toxicity. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the importance of using asparaginase enzyme activity measurements to identify PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity.	
30452639	Genomic analyses in African populations identify novel risk loci for cleft palate.	Orofacial clefts are common developmental disorders that pose significant clinical, economical and psychological problems. We conducted genome-wide association analyses for cleft palate only (CPO) and cleft lip with or without palate (CL/P) with ~17 million markers in sub-Saharan Africans. After replication and combined analyses, we identified novel loci for CPO at or near genome-wide significance on chromosomes 2 (near CTNNA2) and 19 (near SULT2A1). In situ hybridization of Sult2a1 in mice showed expression of SULT2A1 in mesenchymal cells in palate, palatal rugae and palatal epithelium in the fused palate. The previously reported 8q24 was the most significant locus for CL/P in our study, and we replicated several previously reported loci including PAX7 and VAX1.	
30456828	Sex differences in the genetic architecture of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly heritable complex phenotype that demonstrates sex differences in age of onset and clinical presentation, suggesting a possible sex difference in underlying genetic architecture. We present the first genome-wide characterization of the sex-specific genetic architecture of OCD, utilizing the largest set of OCD cases and controls available from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. We assessed evidence for several mechanisms that may contribute to sex differences including a sex-dependent liability threshold, the presence of individual sex-specific risk variants on the autosomes and the X chromosome, and sex-specific pleiotropic effects. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that genetic heterogeneity between the sexes may obscure associations in a sex-combined genome-wide association study. We observed a strong genetic correlation between male and female OCD and no evidence for a sex-dependent liability threshold model, suggesting that sex-combined analysis does not suffer from widespread loss of power because of genetic heterogeneity between the sexes. While we did not detect any significant sex-specific genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associations, we did identify two significant gene-based associations in females: GRID2 and GRP135, which showed no association in males. We observed that the SNPs with sexually differentiated effects showed an enrichment of regulatory variants influencing expression of genes in brain and immune tissues. These findings suggest that future studies with larger sample sizes hold great promise for the identification of sex-specific genetic risk factors for OCD.	
30586737	Genome-Wide Association Transethnic Meta-Analyses Identifies Novel Associations Regulating Coagulation Factor VIII and von Willebrand Factor Plasma Levels.	Factor VIII (FVIII) and its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) are associated with risk of arterial and venous thrombosis and with hemorrhagic disorders. We aimed to identify and functionally test novel genetic associations regulating plasma FVIII and VWF. We meta-analyzed genome-wide association results from 46 354 individuals of European, African, East Asian, and Hispanic ancestry. All studies performed linear regression analysis using an additive genetic model and associated ≈35 million imputed variants with natural log-transformed phenotype levels. In vitro gene silencing in cultured endothelial cells was performed for candidate genes to provide additional evidence on association and function. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were applied to test the causal role of FVIII and VWF plasma levels on the risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events. We identified 13 novel genome-wide significant ( P≤2.5×10(-8)) associations, 7 with FVIII levels ( FCHO2/TMEM171/TNPO1, HLA, SOX17/RP1, LINC00583/NFIB, RAB5C-KAT2A, RPL3/TAB1/SYNGR1, and ARSA) and 11 with VWF levels ( PDHB/PXK/KCTD6, SLC39A8, FCHO2/TMEM171/TNPO1, HLA, GIMAP7/GIMAP4, OR13C5/NIPSNAP, DAB2IP, C2CD4B, RAB5C-KAT2A, TAB1/SYNGR1, and ARSA), beyond 10 previously reported associations with these phenotypes. Functional validation provided further evidence of association for all loci on VWF except ARSA and DAB2IP. Mendelian randomization suggested causal effects of plasma FVIII activity levels on venous thrombosis and coronary artery disease risk and plasma VWF levels on ischemic stroke risk. The meta-analysis identified 13 novel genetic loci regulating FVIII and VWF plasma levels, 10 of which we validated functionally. We provide some evidence for a causal role of these proteins in thrombotic events.	
30470734	Evidence for genetic contribution to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in schizophrenia.	The epidemiologic link between schizophrenia (SCZ) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the presence and extent of a shared genetic background between SCZ and T2D using genome-wide approaches. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and polygenic risk score analysis in a Greek sample collection (GOMAP) comprising three patient groups: SCZ only (n = 924), T2D only (n = 822), comorbid SCZ and T2D (n = 505); samples from two separate Greek cohorts were used as population-based controls (n = 1,125). We used genome-wide summary statistics from two large-scale GWAS of SCZ and T2D from the PGC and DIAGRAM consortia, respectively, to perform genetic overlap analyses, including a regional colocalisation test. We show for the first time that patients with comorbid SCZ and T2D have a higher genetic predisposition to both disorders compared to controls. We identify five genomic regions with evidence of colocalising SCZ and T2D signals, three of which contain known loci for both diseases. We also observe a significant excess of shared association signals between SCZ and T2D at nine out of ten investigated p value thresholds. Finally, we identify 29 genes associated with both T2D and SCZ, several of which have been implicated in biological processes relevant to these disorders. Together our results demonstrate that the observed comorbidity between SCZ and T2D is at least in part due to shared genetic mechanisms.	
30468137	Genome-wide association study of treatment-resistance in depression and meta-analysis of three independent samples.	Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is the most problematic outcome of depression in terms of functional impairment, suicidal thoughts and decline in physical health.AimsTo investigate the genetic predictors of TRD using a genome-wide approach to contribute to the development of precision medicine. A sample recruited by the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression (GSRD) including 1148 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) was characterised for the occurrence of TRD (lack of response to at least two adequate antidepressant treatments) and genotyped using the Infinium PsychArray. Three clinically relevant patient groups were considered: TRD, responders and non-responders to the first antidepressant trial, thus outcomes were based on comparisons of these groups. Genetic analyses were performed at the variant, gene and gene-set (i.e. functionally related genes) level. Additive regression models of the outcomes and relevant covariates were used in the GSRD participants and in a fixed-effect meta-analysis performed between GSRD, STAR*D (n = 1316) and GENDEP (n = 761) participants. No individual polymorphism or gene was associated with TRD, although some suggestive signals showed enrichment in cytoskeleton regulation, transcription modulation and calcium signalling. Two gene sets (GO:0043949 and GO:0000183) were associated with TRD versus response and TRD versus response and non-response to the first treatment in the GSRD participants and in the meta-analysis, respectively (corrected P = 0.030 and P = 0.027). The identified gene sets are involved in cyclic adenosine monophosphate mediated signal and chromatin silencing, two processes previously implicated in antidepressant action. They represent possible biomarkers to implement personalised antidepressant treatments and targets for new antidepressants.Declaration of interestD.S. has received grant/research support from GlaxoSmithKline and Lundbeck; has served as a consultant or on advisory boards for AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Janssen and Lundbeck.

30478444	Discovery of the first genome-wide significant risk loci for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable childhood behavioral disorder affecting 5% of children and 2.5% of adults. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ADHD susceptibility, but no variants have been robustly associated with ADHD. We report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 20,183 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 35,191 controls that identifies variants surpassing genome-wide significance in 12 independent loci, finding important new information about the underlying biology of ADHD. Associations are enriched in evolutionarily constrained genomic regions and loss-of-function intolerant genes and around brain-expressed regulatory marks. Analyses of three replication studies: a cohort of individuals diagnosed with ADHD, a self-reported ADHD sample and a meta-analysis of quantitative measures of ADHD symptoms in the population, support these findings while highlighting study-specific differences on genetic overlap with educational attainment. Strong concordance with GWAS of quantitative population measures of ADHD symptoms supports that clinical diagnosis of ADHD is an extreme expression of continuous heritable traits.	
30487518	Interethnic analyses of blood pressure loci in populations of East Asian and European descent.	Blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and more than 200 genetic loci associated with BP are known. Here, we perform a multi-stage genome-wide association study for BP (max N = 289,038) principally in East Asians and meta-analysis in East Asians and Europeans. We report 19 new genetic loci and ancestry-specific BP variants, conforming to a common ancestry-specific variant association model. At 10 unique loci, distinct non-rare ancestry-specific variants colocalize within the same linkage disequilibrium block despite the significantly discordant effects for the proxy shared variants between the ethnic groups. The genome-wide transethnic correlation of causal-variant effect-sizes is 0.898 and 0.851 for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. Some of the ancestry-specific association signals are also influenced by a selective sweep. Our results provide new evidence for the role of common ancestry-specific variants and natural selection in ethnic differences in complex traits such as BP.	
30487263	Multiethnic Genome-Wide Association Study of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Liability Threshold Modeling of Duration of Diabetes and Glycemic Control.	To identify genetic variants associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR), we performed a large multiethnic genome-wide association study. Discovery included eight European cohorts ((n) = 3,246) and seven African American cohorts ((n) = 2,611). We meta-analyzed across cohorts using inverse-variance weighting, with and without liability threshold modeling of glycemic control and duration of diabetes. Variants with a(P) value <1 × 10(-5) were investigated in replication cohorts that included 18,545 European, 16,453 Asian, and 2,710 Hispanic subjects. After correction for multiple testing, the C allele of rs142293996 in an intron of nuclear VCP-like ((NVL)) was associated with DR in European discovery cohorts ((P) = 2.1 × 10(-9)), but did not reach genome-wide significance after meta-analysis with replication cohorts. We applied the Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator (DAPPLE) to our discovery results to test for evidence of risk being spread across underlying molecular pathways. One protein-protein interaction network built from genes in regions associated with proliferative DR was found to have significant connectivity ((P) = 0.0009) and corroborated with gene set enrichment analyses. These findings suggest that genetic variation in(NVL,) as well as variation within a protein-protein interaction network that includes genes implicated in inflammation, may influence risk for DR.	
30500874	A Genome-wide Association Study Identifying RAP1A as a Novel Susceptibility Gene for Crohn's Disease in Japanese Individuals.	Genome-wide association studies [GWASs] of European populations have identified numerous susceptibility loci for Crohn's disease [CD]. Susceptibility genes differ by ethnicity, however, so GWASs specific for Asian populations are required. This study aimed to clarify the Japanese-specific genetic background for CD by a GWAS using the Japonica array [JPA] and subsequent imputation with the 1KJPN reference panel. Two independent Japanese case/control sets (Tohoku region [379 CD patients, 1621 controls] and Kyushu region [334 CD patients, 462 controls]) were included. GWASs were performed separately for each population, followed by a meta-analysis. Two additional replication sets [254 + 516 CD patients and 287 + 565 controls] were analysed for top hit single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] from novel genomic regions. Genotype data of 4 335 144 SNPs from 713 Japanese CD patients and 2083 controls were analysed. SNPs located in TNFSF15 (rs78898421, Pmeta = 2.59 × 10-26, odds ratio [OR] = 2.10), HLA-DQB1 [rs184950714, pmeta = 3.56 × 10-19, OR = 2.05], ZNF365, and 4p14 loci were significantly associated with CD in Japanese individuals. Replication analyses were performed for four novel candidate loci [p <1 × 10-6], and rs488200 located upstream of RAP1A was significantly associated with CD [pcombined = 4.36 × 10-8, OR = 1.31]. Transcriptome analysis of CD4+ effector memory T cells from lamina propria mononuclear cells of CD patients revealed a significant association of rs488200 with RAP1A expression. RAP1A is a novel susceptibility locus for CD in the Japanese population.	
30498034	Genetic determinants and an epistasis of 	Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a systemic vasculitis with severe complications that affects the aorta and its large branches. HLA-B*52 is an established susceptibility locus to TAK. To date, there are still only a limited number of reports concerning non-HLA susceptibility loci to TAK. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a follow-up study in a total of 633 TAK cases and 5,928 controls. A total of 510,879 SNPs were genotyped, and 5,875,450 SNPs were imputed together with HLA-B*52. Functional annotation of significant loci, enhancer enrichment, and pathway analyses were conducted. We identified four unreported significant loci, namely rs2322599, rs103294, rs17133698, and rs1713450, in(PTK2B),(LILRA3)/(LILRB2),(DUSP22), and(KLHL33), respectively. Two additional significant loci unreported in non-European GWAS were identified, namely(HSPA6)/(FCGR3A) and chr21q.22. We found that a single variant associated with the expression of(MICB), a ligand for natural killer (NK) cell receptor, could explain the entire association with the(HLA-B) region. Rs2322599 is strongly associated with the expression of(PTK2B) Rs103294 risk allele in(LILRA3)/(LILRB2) is known to be a tagging SNP for the deletion of(LILRA3), a soluble receptor of HLA class I molecules. We found a significant epistasis effect between HLA-B*52 and rs103294 ((P) = 1.2 × 10(-3)). Enhancer enrichment analysis and pathway analysis suggested the involvement of NK cells ((P) = 8.8 × 10(-5), enhancer enrichment). In conclusion, four unreported TAK susceptibility loci and an epistasis effect between(LILRA3) and HLA-B*52 were identified. HLA and non-HLA regions suggested a critical role for NK cells in TAK.	
30504769	Genome-wide association meta-analysis yields 20 loci associated with gallstone disease.	Gallstones are responsible for one of the most common diseases in the Western world and are commonly treated with cholecystectomy. We perform a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies of gallstone disease in Iceland and the UK, totaling 27,174 cases and 736,838 controls, uncovering 21 novel gallstone-associated variants at 20 loci. Two distinct low frequency missense variants in SLC10A2, encoding the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), associate with an increased risk of gallstone disease (Pro290Ser: OR = 1.36 [1.25-1.49], P = 2.1 × 10(-12), MAF = 1%; Val98Ile: OR = 1.15 [1.10-1.20], P = 1.8 × 10(-10), MAF = 4%). We demonstrate that lower bile acid transport by ASBT is accompanied by greater risk of gallstone disease and highlight the role of the intestinal compartment of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in gallstone disease susceptibility. Additionally, two low frequency missense variants in SERPINA1 and HNF4A and 17 common variants represent novel associations with gallstone disease.	
30566020	Clinical and Genetic Determinants of Varicose Veins.	Varicose veins are a common problem with no approved medical therapies. Although it is believed that varicose vein pathogenesis is multifactorial, there is limited understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to their formation. Large-scale studies of risk factors for varicose veins may highlight important aspects of pathophysiology and identify groups at increased risk for disease. We applied machine learning to agnostically search for risk factors of varicose veins in 493 519 individuals in the UK Biobank. Predictors were further studied with univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses (2441 incident events). A genome-wide association study of varicose veins was also performed among 337 536 unrelated individuals (9577 cases) of white British descent, followed by expression quantitative loci and pathway analyses. Because height emerged as a new candidate risk factor, we performed mendelian randomization analyses to assess a potential causal role for height in varicose vein development. Machine learning confirmed several known (age, sex, obesity, pregnancy, history of deep vein thrombosis) and identified several new risk factors for varicose vein disease, including height. After adjustment for traditional risk factors in Cox regression, greater height remained independently associated with varicose veins (hazard ratio for upper versus lower quartile, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.51-2.01; P<0.0001). A genome-wide association study identified 30 new genome-wide significant loci, identifying pathways involved in vascular development and skeletal/limb biology. Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence that increased height is causally related to varicose veins (inverse-variance weighted: odds ratio, 1.26; P=2.07×10(-16)). Using data from nearly a half-million individuals, we present a comprehensive genetic and epidemiological study of varicose veins. We identified novel clinical and genetic risk factors that provide pathophysiological insights and could help future improvements of treatment of varicose vein disease.	
30578281	A locus on chromosome 5 shows African ancestry-limited association with alloimmunization in sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a critical therapeutic intervention in sickle cell disease (SCD); however, the apparent propensity of some patients to regularly develop RBC alloantibodies after transfusion presents a significant challenge to finding compatible blood for so-called alloimmunization responders. Predisposing genetic loci have long been thought to contribute to the responder phenomenon, but to date, no definitive loci have been identified. We undertook a genome-wide association study of alloimmunization responder status in 267 SCD multiple transfusion recipients, using genetic estimates of ancestral admixture to bolster our findings. Analyses revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosomes 2 and 5 approaching genome-wide significance (minimum(P) = 2.0 × 10(-8) and 8.4 × 10(-8), respectively), with local ancestry analysis demonstrating similar levels of admixture in responders and nonresponders at implicated loci. Association at chromosome 5 was nominally replicated in an independent cohort of 130 SCD transfusion recipients, with meta-analysis surpassing genome-wide significance (rs75853687,P = 6.6 × 10(-9)), and this extended to individuals forming multiple (>3) alloantibodies (P = 9.4 × 10(-5)). The associated variant is rare outside of African populations, and orthogonal genome-wide haplotype analyses, contingent on local ancestry, revealed genome-wide significant sharing of a ∼60-kb haplotype of African ancestry at the chromosome 5 locus (Bayes Factor = 4.95). This locus overlaps a putative(cis-)acting enhancer predicted to regulate transcription of(ADRA1B) and the lncRNA(LINC01847), both members of larger ontologies associated with immune regulation. Our findings provide potential insights to the pathophysiology underlying the development of alloantibodies and implicate non-RBC ancestry-limited loci in the susceptibility to alloimmunization.
30525989	Bivariate Genome-Wide Association Scan Identifies 6 Novel Loci Associated With Lipid Levels and Coronary Artery Disease.	Plasma lipid levels are heritable and genetically associated with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) routinely analyze these traits independent of one another. Joint GWAS for two related phenotypes can lead to a higher powered analysis to detect variants contributing to both traits. We performed a bivariate GWAS to discover novel loci associated with both heart disease, using a CAD meta-analysis (122 733 cases and 424 528 controls), and lipid traits, using results from the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium (188 577 subjects). We identified six previously unreported loci at genome-wide significance ( P<5×10(-8)), three which were associated with triglycerides and CAD, two which were associated with LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and CAD, and one associated with total cholesterol and CAD. At several of our loci, the GWAS signals jointly localize with genetic variants associated with expression level changes for more than one neighboring genes, indicating that these loci may be affecting disease risk through regulatory activity. We discovered six novel variants individually associated with both lipids and CAD.	
30510157	GWAS and colocalization analyses implicate carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque loci in cardiovascular outcomes.	Carotid artery intima media thickness (cIMT) and carotid plaque are measures of subclinical atherosclerosis associated with ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD). Here, we undertake meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 71,128 individuals for cIMT, and 48,434 individuals for carotid plaque traits. We identify eight novel susceptibility loci for cIMT, one independent association at the previously-identified PINX1 locus, and one novel locus for carotid plaque. Colocalization analysis with nearby vascular expression quantitative loci (cis-eQTLs) derived from arterial wall and metabolic tissues obtained from patients with CHD identifies candidate genes at two potentially additional loci, ADAMTS9 and LOXL4. LD score regression reveals significant genetic correlations between cIMT and plaque traits, and both cIMT and plaque with CHD, any stroke subtype and ischemic stroke. Our study provides insights into genes and tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms linking atherosclerosis both to its functional genomic origins and its clinical consequences in humans.	
30510241	Discovery of common and rare genetic risk variants for colorectal cancer.	To further dissect the genetic architecture of colorectal cancer (CRC), we performed whole-genome sequencing of 1,439 cases and 720 controls, imputed discovered sequence variants and Haplotype Reference Consortium panel variants into genome-wide association study data, and tested for association in 34,869 cases and 29,051 controls. Findings were followed up in an additional 23,262 cases and 38,296 controls. We discovered a strongly protective 0.3% frequency variant signal at CHD1. In a combined meta-analysis of 125,478 individuals, we identified 40 new independent signals at P < 5 × 10(-8), bringing the number of known independent signals for CRC to ~100. New signals implicate lower-frequency variants, Krüppel-like factors, Hedgehog signaling, Hippo-YAP signaling, long noncoding RNAs and somatic drivers, and support a role for immune function. Heritability analyses suggest that CRC risk is highly polygenic, and larger, more comprehensive studies enabling rare variant analysis will improve understanding of biology underlying this risk and influence personalized screening strategies and drug development.	
30514930	Genetic data and cognitively defined late-onset Alzheimer's disease subgroups.	Categorizing people with late-onset Alzheimer's disease into biologically coherent subgroups is important for personalized medicine. We evaluated data from five studies (total n = 4050, of whom 2431 had genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data). We assigned people to cognitively defined subgroups on the basis of relative performance in memory, executive functioning, visuospatial functioning, and language at the time of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. We compared genotype frequencies for each subgroup to those from cognitively normal elderly controls. We focused on APOE and on SNPs with p < 10(-5) and odds ratios more extreme than those previously reported for Alzheimer's disease (<0.77 or >1.30). There was substantial variation across studies in the proportions of people in each subgroup. In each study, higher proportions of people with isolated substantial relative memory impairment had ≥1 APOE ε4 allele than any other subgroup (overall p = 1.5 × 10(-27)). Across subgroups, there were 33 novel suggestive loci across the genome with p < 10(-5) and an extreme OR compared to controls, of which none had statistical evidence of heterogeneity and 30 had ORs in the same direction across all datasets. These data support the biological coherence of cognitively defined subgroups and nominate novel genetic loci.	
30563176	Association of Genetic Variation at 	Despite its substantial clinical importance, specific genetic variants associated with depression have not yet been identified. We sought to identify genetic variants associated with depression by (a) focusing on a more homogenous subsample (vascular depression) and (b) applying a three-stage approach. First, we contacted 730 participants with a confirmed atherosclerotic disease (coronary artery disease) from a population-based study population (German Myocardial Infarction Family Study IV) for psychiatric assessment with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Second, we genotyped these patients using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Third, we characterized the SNP via in-silico analysis. The final sample consisted of 342 patients (78.3% male, age = 63.2 ± 9.9 years), 22.8% with a severe depressive disorder. Variant rs528732638 on chromosome 18q11.2 was a genome-wide significant variant and was associated with 3.6-fold increase in the odds of lifetime depression. The locus belongs to a linkage disequilibrium block showing expression quantitative trait loci effects on three putative(cis)-regulated genes, including the aquaporin 4 ((AQP4)) locus.(AQP4) is already known to mediate the formation of ischemic edema in the brain and heart, increasing the size and extent of resulting lesions. Our findings indicate that(AQP4) may also play a role in the etiopathology of vascular depression.	
30527956	Genetic determinants of risk in pulmonary arterial hypertension: international genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis.	Rare genetic variants cause pulmonary arterial hypertension, but the contribution of common genetic variation to disease risk and natural history is poorly characterised. We tested for genome-wide association for pulmonary arterial hypertension in large international cohorts and assessed the contribution of associated regions to outcomes. We did two separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a meta-analysis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. These GWAS used data from four international case-control studies across 11 744 individuals with European ancestry (including 2085 patients). One GWAS used genotypes from 5895 whole-genome sequences and the other GWAS used genotyping array data from an additional 5849 individuals. Cross-validation of loci reaching genome-wide significance was sought by meta-analysis. Conditional analysis corrected for the most significant variants at each locus was used to resolve signals for multiple associations. We functionally annotated associated variants and tested associations with duration of survival. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint in survival analyses. A locus near SOX17 (rs10103692, odds ratio 1·80 [95% CI 1·55-2·08], p=5·13 × 10(-15)) and a second locus in HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 (collectively referred to as HLA-DPA1/DPB1 here; rs2856830, 1·56 [1·42-1·71], p=7·65 × 10(-20)) within the class II MHC region were associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The SOX17 locus had two independent signals associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (rs13266183, 1·36 [1·25-1·48], p=1·69 × 10(-12); and rs10103692). Functional and epigenomic data indicate that the risk variants near SOX17 alter gene regulation via an enhancer active in endothelial cells. Pulmonary arterial hypertension risk variants determined haplotype-specific enhancer activity, and CRISPR-mediated inhibition of the enhancer reduced SOX17 expression. The HLA-DPA1/DPB1 rs2856830 genotype was strongly associated with survival. Median survival from diagnosis in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with the C/C homozygous genotype was double (13·50 years [95% CI 12·07 to >13·50]) that of those with the T/T genotype (6·97 years [6·02-8·05]), despite similar baseline disease severity. This is the first study to report that common genetic variation at loci in an enhancer near SOX17 and in HLA-DPA1/DPB1 is associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Impairment of SOX17 function might be more common in pulmonary arterial hypertension than suggested by rare mutations in SOX17. Further studies are needed to confirm the association between HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping and survival, and to determine whether HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping improves risk stratification in clinical practice or trials.

30529582	Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Study of East Asians Identifies Loci Associated With Risk for Colorectal Cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have associated approximately 50 loci with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)-nearly one third of these loci were initially associated with CRC in studies conducted in East Asian populations. We conducted a GWAS of East Asians to identify CRC risk loci and evaluate the generalizability of findings from GWASs of European populations to Asian populations. We analyzed genetic data from 22,775 patients with CRC (cases) and 47,731 individuals without cancer (controls) from 14 studies in the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium. First, we performed a meta-analysis of 7 GWASs (10,625 cases and 34,595 controls) and identified 46,554 promising risk variants for replication by adding them to the Multi-Ethnic Global Array (MEGA) for genotype analysis in 6445 cases and 7175 controls. These data were analyzed, along with data from an additional 5705 cases and 5961 controls genotyped using the OncoArray. We also obtained data from 57,976 cases and 67,242 controls of European descent. Variants at identified risk loci were functionally annotated and evaluated in correlation with gene expression levels. A meta-analyses of all samples from people of Asian descent identified 13 loci and 1 new variant at a known locus (10q24.2) associated with risk of CRC at the genome-wide significance level of P < 5 × 10(-8). We did not perform experiments to replicate these associations in additional individuals of Asian ancestry. However, the lead risk variant in 6 of these loci was also significantly associated with risk of CRC in European descendants. A strong association (44%-75% increase in risk per allele) was found for 2 low-frequency variants: rs201395236 at 1q44 (minor allele frequency, 1.34%) and rs77969132 at 12p11.21 (minor allele frequency, 1.53%). For 8 of the 13 associated loci, the variants with the highest levels of significant association were located inside or near the protein-coding genes L1TD1, EFCAB2, PPP1R21, SLCO2A1, HLA-G, NOTCH4, DENND5B, and GNAS. For other intergenic loci, we provided evidence for the possible involvement of the genes ALDH7A1, PRICKLE1, KLF5, WWOX, and GLP2R. We replicated findings for 41 of 52 previously reported risk loci. We showed that most of the risk loci previously associated with CRC risk in individuals of European descent were also associated with CRC risk in East Asians. Furthermore, we identified 13 loci significantly associated with risk for CRC in Asians. Many of these loci contained genes that regulate the immune response, Wnt signaling to β-catenin, prostaglandin E2 catabolism, and cell pluripotency and proliferation. Further analyses of these genes and their variants is warranted, particularly for the 8 loci for which the lead CRC risk variants were not replicated in persons of European descent.	
30535121	Genome-wide association analyses identify 139 loci associated with macular thickness in the UK Biobank cohort.	The macula, located near the center of the retina in the human eye, is responsible for providing critical functions, such as central, sharp vision. Structural changes in the macula are associated with many ocular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma. Although macular thickness is a highly heritable trait, there are no prior reported genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of it. Here we describe the first GWAS of macular thickness, which was measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography using 68 423 participants from the UK Biobank cohort. We identified 139 genetic loci associated with macular thickness at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8). The most significant loci were LINC00461 (P = 5.1 × 10-120), TSPAN10 (P = 1.2 × 10-118), RDH5 (P = 9.2 × 10-105) and SLC6A20 (P = 1.4 × 10-71). Results from gene expression demonstrated that these genes are highly expressed in the retina. Other hits included many previously reported AMD genes, such as NPLOC4 (P = 1.7 × 10-103), RAD51B (P = 9.1 × 10-14) and SLC16A8 (P = 1.7 × 10-8), further providing functional significance of the identified loci. Through cross-phenotype analysis, these genetic loci also exhibited pleiotropic effects with myopia, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease), cancer (e.g. breast, ovarian and lung cancers) and metabolic traits (e.g. body mass index, waist circumference and type 2 diabetes). Our findings provide the first insight into the genetic architecture of macular thickness and may further elucidate the pathogenesis of related ocular diseases, such as AMD.	
30531935	Common-variant associations with fragile X syndrome.	Fragile X syndrome is rare but a prominent cause of intellectual disability. It is usually caused by a de novo mutation that occurs on multiple haplotypes and thus would not be expected to be detectible using genome-wide association (GWA). We conducted GWA in 89 male FXS cases and 266 male controls, and detected multiple genome-wide significant signals near FMR1 (odds ratio = 8.10, P = 2.5 × 10(-10)). These findings withstood robust attempts at falsification. Fine-mapping yielded a minimum P = 1.13 × 10(-14), but did not narrow the interval. Comprehensive functional genomic integration did not provide a mechanistic hypothesis. Controls carrying a risk haplotype had significantly longer FMR1 CGG repeats than controls with the protective haplotype (P = 4.75 × 10(-5)), which may predispose toward increases in CGG number to the premutation range over many generations. This is a salutary reminder of the complexity of even "simple" monogenetic disorders.	
30531825	Genome-wide study of hair colour in UK Biobank explains most of the SNP heritability.	Natural hair colour within European populations is a complex genetic trait. Previous work has established that MC1R variants are the principal genetic cause of red hair colour, but with variable penetrance. Here, we have extensively mapped the genes responsible for hair colour in the white, British ancestry, participants in UK Biobank. MC1R only explains 73% of the SNP heritability for red hair in UK Biobank, and in fact most individuals with two MC1R variants have blonde or light brown hair. We identify other genes contributing to red hair, the combined effect of which accounts for ~90% of the SNP heritability. Blonde hair is associated with over 200 genetic variants and we find a continuum from black through dark and light brown to blonde and account for 73% of the SNP heritability of blonde hair. Many of the associated genes are involved in hair growth or texture, emphasising the cellular connections between keratinocytes and melanocytes in the determination of hair colour.	
30531953	Genome-wide mega-analysis identifies 16 loci and highlights diverse biological mechanisms in the common epilepsies.	The epilepsies affect around 65 million people worldwide and have a substantial missing heritability component. We report a genome-wide mega-analysis involving 15,212 individuals with epilepsy and 29,677 controls, which reveals 16 genome-wide significant loci, of which 11 are novel. Using various prioritization criteria, we pinpoint the 21 most likely epilepsy genes at these loci, with the majority in genetic generalized epilepsies. These genes have diverse biological functions, including coding for ion-channel subunits, transcription factors and a vitamin-B6 metabolism enzyme. Converging evidence shows that the common variants associated with epilepsy play a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the brain. The results show an enrichment for monogenic epilepsy genes as well as known targets of antiepileptic drugs. Using SNP-based heritability analyses we disentangle both the unique and overlapping genetic basis to seven different epilepsy subtypes. Together, these findings provide leads for epilepsy therapies based on underlying pathophysiology.	
30531941	GWAS identifies 14 loci for device-measured physical activity and sleep duration.	Physical activity and sleep duration are established risk factors for many diseases, but their aetiology is poorly understood, partly due to relying on self-reported evidence. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of device-measured physical activity and sleep duration in 91,105 UK Biobank participants, finding 14 significant loci (7 novel). These loci account for 0.06% of activity and 0.39% of sleep duration variation. Genome-wide estimates of ~ 15% phenotypic variation indicate high polygenicity. Heritability is higher in women than men for overall activity (23 vs. 20%, p = 1.5 × 10(-4)) and sedentary behaviours (18 vs. 15%, p = 9.7 × 10(-4)). Heritability partitioning, enrichment and pathway analyses indicate the central nervous system plays a role in activity behaviours. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation suggests that increased activity might causally lower diastolic blood pressure (beta mmHg/SD: -0.91, SE = 0.18, p = 8.2 × 10(-7)), and odds of hypertension (Odds ratio/SD: 0.84, SE = 0.03, p = 4.9 × 10(-8)). Our results advocate the value of physical activity for reducing blood pressure.	
30552067	Moderate-to-severe asthma in individuals of European ancestry: a genome-wide association study.	Few genetic studies that focus on moderate-to-severe asthma exist. We aimed to identity novel genetic variants associated with moderate-to-severe asthma, see whether previously identified genetic variants for all types of asthma contribute to moderate-to-severe asthma, and provide novel mechanistic insights using expression analyses in patients with asthma. In this genome-wide association study, we used a two-stage case-control design. In stage 1, we genotyped patient-level data from two UK cohorts (the Genetics of Asthma Severity and Phenotypes [GASP] initiative and the Unbiased BIOmarkers in PREDiction of respiratory disease outcomes [U-BIOPRED] project) and used data from the UK Biobank to collect patient-level genomic data for cases and controls of European ancestry in a 1:5 ratio. Cases were defined as having moderate-to-severe asthma if they were taking appropriate medication or had been diagnosed by a doctor. Controls were defined as not having asthma, rhinitis, eczema, allergy, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis as diagnosed by a doctor. For stage 2, an independent cohort of cases and controls (1:5) was selected from the UK Biobank only, with no overlap with stage 1 samples. In stage 1 we undertook a genome-wide association study of moderate-to-severe asthma, and in stage 2 we followed up independent variants that reached the significance threshold of p less than 1 × 10(-6) in stage 1. We set genome-wide significance at p less than 5 × 10(-8). For novel signals, we investigated their effect on all types of asthma (mild, moderate, and severe). For all signals meeting genome-wide significance, we investigated their effect on gene expression in patients with asthma and controls. We included 5135 cases and 25 675 controls for stage 1, and 5414 cases and 21 471 controls for stage 2. We identified 24 genome-wide significant signals of association with moderate-to-severe asthma, including several signals in innate or adaptive immune-response genes. Three novel signals were identified: rs10905284 in GATA3 (coded allele A, odds ratio [OR] 0·90, 95% CI 0·88-0·93; p=1·76 × 10(-10)), rs11603634 in the MUC5AC region (coded allele G, OR 1·09, 1·06-1·12; p=2·32 × 10(-8)), and rs560026225 near KIAA1109 (coded allele GATT, OR 1·12, 1·08-1·16; p=3·06 × 10(-9)). The MUC5AC signal was not associated with asthma when analyses included mild asthma. The rs11603634 G allele was associated with increased expression of MUC5AC mRNA in bronchial epithelial brush samples via proxy SNP rs11602802; (p=2·50 × 10(-5)) and MUC5AC mRNA was increased in bronchial epithelial samples from patients with severe asthma (in two independent analyses, p=0·039 and p=0·022). We found substantial shared genetic architecture between mild and moderate-to-severe asthma. We also report for the first time genetic variants associated with the risk of developing moderate-to-severe asthma that regulate mucin production. Finally, we identify candidate causal genes in these loci and provide increased insight into this difficult to treat population.

30541042	Agnostic Pathway/Gene Set Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Data Identifies Associations for Pancreatic Cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify associations of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cancer risk but usually only explain a fraction of the inherited variability. Pathway analysis of genetic variants is a powerful tool to identify networks of susceptibility genes. We conducted a large agnostic pathway-based meta-analysis of GWAS data using the summary-based adaptive rank truncated product method to identify gene sets and pathways associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in 9040 cases and 12 496 controls. We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and functional annotation of the top SNPs in genes contributing to the top associated pathways and gene sets. All statistical tests were two-sided. We identified 14 pathways and gene sets associated with PDAC at a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. After Bonferroni correction (P ≤ 1.3 × 10-5), the strongest associations were detected in five pathways and gene sets, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young, regulation of beta-cell development, role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor transactivation by G protein-coupled receptors in cardiac hypertrophy pathways, and the Nikolsky breast cancer chr17q11-q21 amplicon and Pujana ATM Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) network gene sets. We identified and validated rs876493 and three correlating SNPs (PGAP3) and rs3124737 (CASP7) from the Pujana ATM PCC gene set as eQTLs in two normal derived pancreas tissue datasets. Our agnostic pathway and gene set analysis integrated with functional annotation and eQTL analysis provides insight into genes and pathways that may be biologically relevant for risk of PDAC, including those not previously identified.	
30542056	Genome-wide meta-analysis implicates mediators of hair follicle development and morphogenesis in risk for severe acne.	Acne vulgaris is a highly heritable common, chronic inflammatory disease of the skin for which five genetic risk loci have so far been identified. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study of 3823 cases and 16,144 controls followed by meta-analysis with summary statistics from a previous study, with a total sample size of 26,722. We identify 20 independent association signals at 15 risk loci, 12 of which have not been previously implicated in the disease. Likely causal variants disrupt the coding region of WNT10A and a P63 transcription factor binding site in SEMA4B. Risk alleles at the 1q25 locus are associated with increased expression of LAMC2, in which biallelic loss-of-function mutations cause the blistering skin disease epidermolysis bullosa. These findings indicate that variation affecting the structure and maintenance of the skin, in particular the pilosebaceous unit, is a critical aspect of the genetic predisposition to severe acne.	
30552317	Exploratory genome-wide association analysis of response to ketamine and a polygenic analysis of response to scopolamine in depression.	Growing evidence suggests that the glutamatergic modulator ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depressed subjects. The anticholinergic agent scopolamine has also shown promise as a rapid-acting antidepressant. This study applied genome-wide markers to investigate the role of genetic variants in predicting acute antidepressant response to both agents. The ketamine-treated sample included 157 unrelated European subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). The scopolamine-treated sample comprised 37 unrelated European subjects diagnosed with either MDD or BD who had a current Major Depressive Episode (MDE), and had failed at least two adequate treatment trials for depression. Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scale scores at day 1 (24 h post-treatment) was considered the primary outcome. Here, we conduct pilot genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses to identify potential markers of ketamine response and dissociative side effects. Polygenic risk score analysis of SNPs ranked by the strength of their association with ketamine response was then calculated in order to assess whether common genetic markers from the ketamine study could predict response to scopolamine. Findings require replication in larger samples in light of low power of analyses of these small samples. Neverthless, these data provide a promising illustration of our future potential to identify genetic variants underlying rapid treatment response in mood disorders and may ultimately guide individual patient treatment selection in the future.	
30552173	Genetic variation at the glycosaminoglycan metabolism pathway contributes to the risk of psoriatic arthritis but not psoriasis.	Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis affecting up to 30% of patients with psoriasis (Ps). To date, most of the known risk loci for PsA are shared with Ps, and identifying disease-specific variation has proven very challenging. The objective of the present study was to identify genetic variation specific for PsA. We performed a genome-wide association study in a cohort of 835 patients with PsA and 1558 controls from Spain. Genetic association was tested at the single marker level and at the pathway level. Meta-analysis was performed with a case-control cohort of 2847 individuals from North America. To confirm the specificity of the genetic associations with PsA, we tested the associated variation using a purely cutaneous psoriasis cohort (PsC, n=614) and a rheumatoid arthritis cohort (RA, n=1191). Using network and drug-repurposing analyses, we further investigated the potential of the PsA-specific associations to guide the development of new drugs in PsA. We identified a new PsA risk single-nucleotide polymorphism at(B3GNT2) locus (p=1.10e-08). At the pathway level, we found 14 genetic pathways significantly associated with PsA (p(FDR)<0.05). From these, the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism pathway was confirmed to be disease-specific after comparing the PsA cohort with the cohorts of patients with PsC and RA. Finally, we identified candidate drug targets in the GAG metabolism pathway as well as new PsA indications for approved drugs. These findings provide insights into the biological mechanisms that are specific for PsA and could contribute to develop more effective therapies.	
30552108	Genome-Wide Association Study Confirming a Strong Effect of HLA and Identifying Variants in 	The first genome-wide association study of fulminant type 1 diabetes was performed in Japanese individuals. As previously reported using a candidate gene approach, a strong association was observed with multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA region, and the strongest association was observed with rs9268853 in the class II DR region ((P) = 1.56 × 10(-23), odds ratio [OR] 3.18). In addition, rs11170445 in(CSAD/lnc-ITGB7-1) on chromosome 12q13.13 showed an association at a genome-wide significance level ((P) = 7.58 × 10(-9), OR 1.96). Fine mapping of the region revealed that rs3782151 in(CSAD/lnc-ITGB7-1) showed the lowest(P) value ((P) = 4.60 × 10(-9), OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.57-2.48]). The risk allele of rs3782151 is a(cis) expression quantitative trait locus for(ITGB7) that significantly increases the expression of this gene.(CSAD/lnc-ITGB7-1) was found to be strongly associated with susceptibility to fulminant, but not classical, autoimmune type 1 diabetes, implicating this locus in the distinct phenotype of fulminant type 1 diabetes.	
30556296	A case-control genome wide association study of substance use disorder (SUD) identifies novel variants on chromosome 7p14.1 in patients from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).	Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have provided insights into the molecular basis of the disorder in different population. This study presents the first GWAS of substance use disorder (SUD) in patients from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The aim was to identify genetic association(s) that may provide insights into the molecular basis of the disorder. The GWAS discovery cohort consisted of 512 (250 cases and 262 controls) male participants from the UAE. Controls with no prior history of SUD were available from the Emirates family registry. The replication cohort consisted of 520 (415 cases and 105 controls) Australian male Caucasian participants. The GWAS discovery samples were genotyped for 4.6 million single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The replication cohort was genotyped using TaqMan assay. The GWAS association analysis identified three potential SNPs rs118129027 (p-value = 6.24 × 10(-8) ), rs74477937 (p-value = 8.56 × 10(-8) ) and rs78707086 (p-value = 8.55 × 10(-8) ) on ch7p14.1, that did not meet the GWAS significance threshold but were highly suggestive. In the replication cohort, the association of the three top SNPs did not reach statistical significance. In a meta-analysis of the discovery and the replication cohorts, there were no strengthen evidence for association of the three SNPs. The top identified rs118129027 overlaps with a regulatory factor (enhancer) region that targets three neighboring genes LOC105375237, LOC105375240, and YAE1D1. The YAE1D1, which represents a potential locus that is involved in regulating translation initiation pathway. Novel associations that require further confirmation were identified, suggesting a new insight to the genetic basis of SUD.	
30557370	Genome wide association study to identify predictors for severe skin toxicity in colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab.	EGFR-antibodies are associated with significant skin toxicity, including acneiform rash and folliculitis. It remains impossible to predict the occurrence of severe skin toxicity due to the lack of predictive markers. Here, we present the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with EGFR inhibitor-induced skin toxicity using data of the multicentre randomized phase III CAIRO2 trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00208546). In this study, advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab with or without cetuximab. Germline DNA was available in 282 of the 368 patients in the cetuximab arm. Mild skin toxicity occurred in 195 patients (i.e. CTC grade 1 or 2, respectively 91 and 104 patients) and severe skin toxicity (i.e. grade 3) in 36 patients. Grade 4 skin toxicity did not occur. None of the SNPs reached the formal genome wide threshold for significance of 5x10(-8), though SNPs of at least 8 loci did show moderate association (p-value between 5x10(-7) and 5x10(-5)) with the occurrence of grade 3 (severe) skin toxicity. These SNPs did not overlap with SNPs associated with cetuximab efficacy as found in a previous GWAS in the same CAIRO2 cohort. If formally proven by replication, the SNPs associated with severe EGFR induced skin toxicity may be helpful to predict the occurrence and severity of skin toxicity in patients that will receive cetuximab and allow for adequate information on the risk of skin toxicity and prophylactic measurements.	
30557369	Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ovarian cancer in Japanese predicted regulatory variants in 22q13.1.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified greater than 30 variants associated with ovarian cancer, but most of these variants were investigated in European populations. Here, we integrated GWAS and subsequent functional analyses to identify the genetic variants with potential regulatory effects. We conducted GWAS for ovarian cancer using 681 Japanese cases and 17,492 controls and found that rs137672 on 22q13.1 exhibited a strong association with a P-value of 1.05 × 10(-7) and an odds ratio of 0.573 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.466-0.703. In addition, three previously reported SNPs, i.e., rs10088218, rs9870207 and rs1400482, were validated in the Japanese population (P < 0.05) with the same risk allele as noted in previous studies. Functional studies including regulatory feature analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed two regulatory SNPs in 22q13.1, rs2072872 and rs6509, that affect the binding affinity to some nuclear proteins in ovarian cancer cells. The plausible regulatory proteins whose motifs could be affected by the allele changes of these two SNPs were also proposed. Moreover, the protective G allele of rs6509 was associated with a decreased SYNGR1 expression level in normal ovarian tissues. Our findings elucidated the regulatory variants in 22q13.1 that are associated with ovarian cancer risk.	
30563984	A case-control genome-wide association study of ADHD discovers a novel association with the tenascin R (TNR) gene.	It is well-established that there is a strong genetic contribution to the aetiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here, we employed a hypothesis-free genome-wide association study (GWAS) design in a sample of 480 clinical childhood ADHD cases and 1208 controls to search for novel genetic risk loci for ADHD. DNA was genotyped using Illumina's Human Infinium PsychArray-24v1.2., and the data were subsequently imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Rigorous quality control and pruning of genotypes at both individual subject and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) levels was performed. Polygenic risk score (PGRS) analysis revealed that ADHD case-control status was explained by genetic risk for ADHD, but no other major psychiatric disorders. Logistic regression analysis was performed genome-wide to test the association between SNPs and ADHD case-control status. We observed a genome-wide significant association (p = 3.15E-08) between ADHD and rs6686722, mapped to the Tenascin R (TNR) gene. Members of this gene family are extracellular matrix glycoproteins that play a role in neural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. Suggestive evidence of associations with ADHD was observed for an additional 111 SNPs (⩽9.91E-05). Although intriguing, the association between DNA variation in the TNR gene and ADHD should be viewed as preliminary given the small sample size of this discovery dataset.	
30631343	Associations Between Genetic Data and Quantitative Assessment of Normal Facial Asymmetry.	Human facial asymmetry is due to a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. To identify genetic influences on facial asymmetry, we developed a method for automated scoring that summarizes local morphology features and their spatial distribution. A genome-wide association study using asymmetry scores from two local symmetry features was conducted and significant genetic associations were identified for one asymmetry feature, including genes thought to play a role in craniofacial disorders and development:(NFATC)1,(SOX)5,(NBAS), and(TCF)7(L)1. These results provide evidence that normal variation in facial asymmetry may be impacted by common genetic variants and further motivate the development of automated summaries of complex phenotypes.	
30566500	Large-scale genome-wide meta-analysis of polycystic ovary syndrome suggests shared genetic architecture for different diagnosis criteria.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Affected women frequently have metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. PCOS is diagnosed with two different sets of diagnostic criteria, resulting in a phenotypic spectrum of PCOS cases. The genetic similarities between cases diagnosed based on the two criteria have been largely unknown. Previous studies in Chinese and European subjects have identified 16 loci associated with risk of PCOS. We report a fixed-effect, inverse-weighted-variance meta-analysis from 10,074 PCOS cases and 103,164 controls of European ancestry and characterisation of PCOS related traits. We identified 3 novel loci (near PLGRKT, ZBTB16 and MAPRE1), and provide replication of 11 previously reported loci. Only one locus differed significantly in its association by diagnostic criteria; otherwise the genetic architecture was similar between PCOS diagnosed by self-report and PCOS diagnosed by NIH or non-NIH Rotterdam criteria across common variants at 13 loci. Identified variants were associated with hyperandrogenism, gonadotropin regulation and testosterone levels in affected women. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis revealed genetic correlations with obesity, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels and coronary artery disease, indicating shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and PCOS. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested variants associated with body mass index, fasting insulin, menopause timing, depression and male-pattern balding play a causal role in PCOS. The data thus demonstrate 3 novel loci associated with PCOS and similar genetic architecture for all diagnostic criteria. The data also provide the first genetic evidence for a male phenotype for PCOS and a causal link to depression, a previously hypothesized comorbid disease. Thus, the genetics provide a comprehensive view of PCOS that encompasses multiple diagnostic criteria, gender, reproductive potential and mental health.
30566433	A variant within the FTO confers susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.	To explore novel genetic loci for diabetic nephropathy, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for diabetic nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. We analyzed the association of 5,768,242 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, 2,380 nephropathy cases and 5,234 controls. We further performed GWAS for diabetic nephropathy using independent Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, 429 cases and 358 controls and the results of these two GWAS were combined with an inverse variance meta-analysis (stage-1), followed by a de novo genotyping for the candidate SNP loci (p < 1.0 × 10(-4)) in an independent case-control study (Stage-2; 1,213 cases and 1,298 controls). After integrating stage-1 and stage-2 data, we identified one SNP locus, significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy; rs56094641 in FTO, P = 7.74 × 10(-10). We further examined the association of rs56094641 with diabetic nephropathy in independent Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (902 cases and 1,221 controls), and found that the association of this locus with diabetic nephropathy remained significant after integrating all association data (P = 7.62 × 10(-10)). We have identified FTO locus as a novel locus for conferring susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.	
30573740	Dissection of genetic variation and evidence for pleiotropy in male pattern baldness.	Male pattern baldness (MPB) is a sex-limited, age-related, complex trait. We study MPB genetics in 205,327 European males from the UK Biobank. Here we show that MPB is strongly heritable and polygenic, with pedigree-heritability of 0.62 (SE = 0.03) estimated from close relatives, and SNP-heritability of 0.39 (SE = 0.01) from conventionally-unrelated males. We detect 624 near-independent genome-wide loci, contributing SNP-heritability of 0.25 (SE = 0.01), of which 26 X-chromosome loci explain 11.6%. Autosomal genetic variance is enriched for common variants and regions of lower linkage disequilibrium. We identify plausible genetic correlations between MPB and multiple sex-limited markers of earlier puberty, increased bone mineral density (r(g) = 0.15) and pancreatic β-cell function (r(g) = 0.12). Correlations with reproductive traits imply an effect on fitness, consistent with an estimated linear selection gradient of -0.018 per MPB standard deviation. Overall, we provide genetic insights into MPB: a phenotype of interest in its own right, with value as a model sex-limited, complex trait.	
30573655	Genome-wide meta-analysis reveals shared new 	Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are heterogeneous and complex conditions with overlapping clinical symptoms and elevated familial aggregation, which suggests the existence of a shared genetic component. In order to identify this genetic background in a systematic fashion, we performed the first cross-disease genome-wide meta-analysis in systemic seropositive rheumatic diseases, namely, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. We meta-analysed ~6.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 11 678 cases and 19 704 non-affected controls of European descent populations. The functional roles of the associated variants were interrogated using publicly available databases. Our analysis revealed five shared genome-wide significant independent(loci) that had not been previously associated with these diseases:(NAB1),(KPNA4-ARL14),(DGQK),(LIMK1) and(PRR12). All of these(loci) are related with immune processes such as interferon and epidermal growth factor signalling, response to methotrexate, cytoskeleton dynamics and coagulation cascade. Remarkably, several of the associated(loci) are known key players in autoimmunity, which supports the validity of our results. All the associated variants showed significant functional enrichment in DNase hypersensitivity sites, chromatin states and histone marks in relevant immune cells, including shared expression quantitative trait(loci). Additionally, our results were significantly enriched in drugs that are being tested for the treatment of the diseases under study. We have identified shared new risk(loci) with functional value across diseases and pinpoint new potential candidate(loci) that could be further investigated. Our results highlight the potential of drug repositioning among related systemic seropositive rheumatic IMIDs.	
30578418	Trans-ethnic association study of blood pressure determinants in over 750,000 individuals.	In this trans-ethnic multi-omic study, we reinterpret the genetic architecture of blood pressure to identify genes, tissues, phenomes and medication contexts of blood pressure homeostasis. We discovered 208 novel common blood pressure SNPs and 53 rare variants in genome-wide association studies of systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure in up to 776,078 participants from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and collaborating studies, with analysis of the blood pressure clinical phenome in MVP. Our transcriptome-wide association study detected 4,043 blood pressure associations with genetically predicted gene expression of 840 genes in 45 tissues, and mouse renal single-cell RNA sequencing identified upregulated blood pressure genes in kidney tubule cells.	
30583798	GWAS Identifies Risk Locus for Erectile Dysfunction and Implicates Hypothalamic Neurobiology and Diabetes in Etiology.	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition affecting more than 20% of men over 60 years, yet little is known about its genetic architecture. We performed a genome-wide association study of ED in 6,175 case subjects among 223,805 European men and identified one locus at 6q16.3 (lead variant rs57989773, OR 1.20 per C-allele; p = 5.71 × 10(-14)), located between MCHR2 and SIM1. In silico analysis suggests SIM1 to confer ED risk through hypothalamic dysregulation. Mendelian randomization provides evidence that genetic risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus is a cause of ED (OR 1.11 per 1-log unit higher risk of type 2 diabetes). These findings provide insights into the biological underpinnings and the causes of ED and may help prioritize the development of future therapies for this common disorder.	
30583557	The Alkaline Phosphatase (ALPL) Locus Is Associated with B6 Vitamer Levels in CSF and Plasma.	The active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), is essential for human metabolism. The brain is dependent on vitamin B6 for its neurotransmitter balance. To obtain insight into the genetic determinants of vitamin B6 homeostasis, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the B6 vitamers pyridoxal (PL), PLP and the degradation product of vitamin B6, pyridoxic acid (PA). We collected a unique sample set of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from the same healthy human subjects of Dutch ancestry ((n) = 493) and included concentrations and ratios in and between these body fluids in our analysis. Based on a multivariate joint analysis of all B6 vitamers and their ratios, we identified a genome-wide significant association at a locus on chromosome 1 containing the(ALPL) (alkaline phosphatase) gene (minimal(p) = 7.89 × 10(-10), rs1106357, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.46), previously associated with vitamin B6 levels in blood. Subjects homozygous for the minor allele showed a 1.4-times-higher ratio between PLP and PL in plasma, and even a 1.6-times-higher ratio between PLP and PL in CSF than subjects homozygous for the major allele. In addition, we observed a suggestive association with the CSF:plasma ratio of PLP on chromosome 15 (minimal(p) = 7.93 × 10(-7), and MAF = 0.06 for rs28789220). Even though this finding is not reaching genome-wide significance, it highlights the potential of our experimental setup for studying transport and metabolism across the blood⁻CSF barrier. This GWAS of B6 vitamers identifies alkaline phosphatase as a key regulator in human vitamin B6 metabolism in CSF as well as plasma. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the potential of genetic studies of metabolites in plasma and CSF to elucidate biological aspects underlying metabolite generation, transport and degradation.	
30593799	Multi-Ancestry Genome-Wide Association Study of Spontaneous Clearance of Hepatitis C Virus.	Spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurs in approximately 30% of infected persons and less often in populations of African ancestry. Variants in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and in interferon lambda genes are associated with spontaneous HCV clearance, but there have been few studies of these variants in persons of African ancestry. We performed a dense multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of spontaneous clearance of HCV, focusing on individuals of African ancestry. We performed genotype analyses of 4423 people from 3 ancestry groups: 2201 persons of African ancestry (445 with HCV clearance and 1756 with HCV persistence), 1739 persons of European ancestry (701 with HCV clearance and 1036 with HCV persistence), and 486 multi-ancestry Hispanic persons (173 with HCV clearance and 313 with HCV persistence). Samples were genotyped using Illumina (San Diego, CA) arrays and statistically imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project. For each ancestry group, the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with HCV clearance was tested by log-additive analysis, and then a meta-analysis was performed. In the meta-analysis, significant associations with HCV clearance were confirmed at the interferon lambda gene locus IFNL4-IFNL3 (19q13.2) (P = 5.99 × 10(-50)) and the MHC locus 6p21.32 (P = 1.15 × 10(-21)). We also associated HCV clearance with polymorphisms in the G-protein-coupled receptor 158 gene (GPR158) at 10p12.1 (P = 1.80 × 10(-07)). These 3 loci had independent, additive effects of HCV clearance, and account for 6.8% and 5.9% of the variance of HCV clearance in persons of European and African ancestry, respectively. Persons of African or European ancestry carrying all 6 variants were 24-fold and 11-fold, respectively, more likely to clear HCV infection compared with individuals carrying none or 1 of the clearance-associated variants. In a meta-analysis of data from 3 studies, we found variants in MHC genes, IFNL4-IFNL3, and GPR158 to increase odds of HCV clearance in patients of European and African ancestry. These findings could increase our understanding of immune response to and clearance of HCV infection.	
30595370	Leveraging Polygenic Functional Enrichment to Improve GWAS Power.	Functional genomics data has the potential to increase GWAS power by identifying SNPs that have a higher prior probability of association. Here, we introduce a method that leverages polygenic functional enrichment to incorporate coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related genomic annotations into association analyses. We show via simulations with real genotypes that the method, functionally informed novel discovery of risk loci (FINDOR), correctly controls the false-positive rate at null loci and attains a 9%-38% increase in the number of independent associations detected at causal loci, depending on trait polygenicity and sample size. We applied FINDOR to 27 independent complex traits and diseases from the interim UK Biobank release (average N = 130K). Averaged across traits, we attained a 13% increase in genome-wide significant loci detected (including a 20% increase for disease traits) compared to unweighted raw p values that do not use functional data. We replicated the additional loci in independent UK Biobank and non-UK Biobank data, yielding a highly statistically significant replication slope (0.66-0.69) in each case. Finally, we applied FINDOR to the full UK Biobank release (average N = 416K), attaining smaller relative improvements (consistent with simulations) but larger absolute improvements, detecting an additional 583 GWAS loci. In conclusion, leveraging functional enrichment using our method robustly increases GWAS power.	
30595539	Genetic influence on scar height and pliability after burn injury in individuals of European ancestry: A prospective cohort study.	After similar extent of injury there is considerable variability in scarring between individuals, in part due to genetic factors. This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with scar height and pliability after burn injury. An exome-wide array association study and gene pathway analysis were performed on a prospective cohort of 665 patients treated for burn injury. Outcomes were scar height (SH) and scar pliability (SP) sub-scores of the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS). DNA was genotyped using the Infinium(®) HumanCoreExome-24 BeadChip. Associations between genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and SH and SP were estimated using an additive genetic model adjusting for age, sex, number of surgical procedures and % total body surface area of burn in subjects of European ancestry. No individual genetic variants achieved the cut-off threshold of significance. Gene regions were analysed for spatially correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms and significant regions identified using comb-p software. This gene list was subject to gene pathway analysis to find which biological process terms were over-represented. Using this approach biological processes related to the nervous system and cell adhesion were the predominant gene pathways associated with both SH and SP. This study suggests genes associated with innervation may be important in scar fibrosis. Further studies using similar and larger datasets will be essential to validate these findings.	
30589442	Biomarker and Genomic Risk Factors for Liver Function Test Abnormality in Hazardous Drinkers.	Alcohol dependence and long-term excessive alcohol use may cause liver damage, but only some patients develop cirrhosis. Similarly, high alcohol intake without evident liver disease often but not always produces abnormal enzymatic liver function tests (LFTs), particularly gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). We postulate that the factors predisposing to cirrhosis in alcoholics and to liver enzyme abnormality in drinkers are similar, and that biochemical LFTs could therefore be useful as markers of risk of alcoholic liver disease in excessive drinkers. Data from participants in twin and twin-family studies on alcohol use and dependence were used to identify 1,003 people who had reported excessive alcohol intake (28 drinks or more per week). A total of 962 of these provided blood for biochemical tests at the same time. Body mass index (BMI) and biomarkers of metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and iron stores were used in logistic regression with abnormality in serum GGT, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as outcomes. We conducted genome-wide association analyses for GGT, ALT, and AST separately in the group reporting excessive alcohol intake (N = 951) and a low-intake group reporting 14 drinks or fewer per week (N = 8,716), and compared results. Abnormal GGT and ALT among excessive drinkers were associated with higher BMI, triglycerides, insulin, uric acid, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and transferrin saturation; and with lower high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. Abnormal AST was associated with triglycerides, ferritin, and transferrin saturation. ALT was significantly associated with variants at reported genetic loci for alcoholic liver disease (PNPLA3, rs738409, p = 0.0076; TM6SF2, rs10401969, p = 0.0076; HSD17B13, rs10433879, p = 0.0024). Known risk factors for alcoholic cirrhosis including obesity and markers of metabolic syndrome, iron overload and inflammation are associated with liver enzyme abnormality in excessive drinkers.	
30593698	Genomics of body fat percentage may contribute to sex bias in anorexia nervosa.	Anorexia nervosa (AN) occurs nine times more often in females than in males. Although environmental factors likely play a role, the reasons for this imbalanced sex ratio remain unresolved. AN displays high genetic correlations with anthropometric and metabolic traits. Given sex differences in body composition, we investigated the possible metabolic underpinnings of female propensity for AN. We conducted sex-specific GWAS in a healthy and medication-free subsample of the UK Biobank (n = 155,961), identifying 77 genome-wide significant loci associated with body fat percentage (BF%) and 174 with fat-free mass (FFM). Partitioned heritability analysis showed an enrichment for central nervous tissue-associated genes for BF%, which was more prominent in females than males. Genetic correlations of BF% and FFM with the largest GWAS of AN by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were estimated to explore shared genomics. The genetic correlations of BF%(male) and BF%(female) with AN differed significantly from each other (p < .0001, δ = -0.17), suggesting that the female preponderance in AN may, in part, be explained by sex-specific anthropometric and metabolic genetic factors increasing liability to AN.	
30598549	An atlas of genetic influences on osteoporosis in humans and mice.	Osteoporosis is a common aging-related disease diagnosed primarily using bone mineral density (BMD). We assessed genetic determinants of BMD as estimated by heel quantitative ultrasound in 426,824 individuals, identifying 518 genome-wide significant loci (301 novel), explaining 20% of its variance. We identified 13 bone fracture loci, all associated with estimated BMD (eBMD), in ~1.2 million individuals. We then identified target genes enriched for genes known to influence bone density and strength (maximum odds ratio (OR) = 58, P = 1 × 10(-75)) from cell-specific features, including chromatin conformation and accessible chromatin sites. We next performed rapid-throughput skeletal phenotyping of 126 knockout mice with disruptions in predicted target genes and found an increased abnormal skeletal phenotype frequency compared to 526 unselected lines (P < 0.0001). In-depth analysis of one gene, DAAM2, showed a disproportionate decrease in bone strength relative to mineralization. This genetic atlas provides evidence linking associated SNPs to causal genes, offers new insight into osteoporosis pathophysiology, and highlights opportunities for drug development.	
30582445	PATJ Low Frequency Variants Are Associated With Worse Ischemic Stroke Functional Outcome.	Ischemic stroke is among the leading causes of adult disability. Part of the variability in functional outcome after stroke has been attributed to genetic factors but no locus has been consistently associated with stroke outcome. Our aim was to identify genetic loci influencing the recovery process using accurate phenotyping to produce the largest GWAS (genome-wide association study) in ischemic stroke recovery to date. A 12-cohort, 2-phase (discovery-replication and joint) meta-analysis of GWAS included anterior-territory and previously independent ischemic stroke cases. Functional outcome was recorded using 3-month modified Rankin Scale. Analyses were adjusted for confounders such as discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. A gene-based burden test was performed. The discovery phase (n=1225) was followed by open (n=2482) and stringent joint-analyses (n=1791). Those cohorts with modified Rankin Scale recorded at time points other than 3-month or incomplete data on previous functional status were excluded in the stringent analyses. Novel variants in PATJ (Pals1-associated tight junction) gene were associated with worse functional outcome at 3-month after stroke. The top variant was rs76221407 (G allele, β=0.40, P=1.70×10(-9)). Our results identify a set of common variants in PATJ gene associated with 3-month functional outcome at genome-wide significance level. Future studies should examine the role of PATJ in stroke recovery and consider stringent phenotyping to enrich the information captured to unveil additional stroke outcome loci.	
30610941	Genome-wide association study in two populations to determine genetic variants associated with Toxoplasma gondii infection and relationship to schizophrenia risk.	T. gondii (TOXO) infects over one billion people worldwide, yet the literature lacks a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) focused on genetic variants controlling the persistence of TOXO infection. To identify putative T. gondii susceptibility genes, we performed a GWAS using IgG seropositivity as the outcome variable in a discovery sample (n = 790) from an Ashkenazi dataset, and a second sample of predominately African Americans (The Grady Trauma Project, n = 285). We also performed a meta-analyses of the 2 cohorts. None of the SNPs in these analyses was statistically significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. In the Ashkenazi population, the gene region of CHIA (chitinase) showed the most nominally significant association with TOXO. Prior studies have shown that the production of chitinase by macrophages in the brain responding to TOXO infection is crucial for controlling the burden of T. gondii cysts. We found a surprising number of genes involved in neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders among our top hits even though our outcome variable was TOXO infection. In the meta-analysis combining the Ashkenazi and Grady Trauma Project samples, there was enrichment for genes implicated in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (p < .05). Upon limiting our sample to those without mental illness, two schizophrenia related genes (CNTNAP2, GABAR2) still had significant TOXO-associated variants at the p < .05 level, but did not pass the genome wide significance threshold after correction for multiple comparisons. Using Ingenuity Systems molecular network analysis, we identified molecular nodes suggesting that while different genetic variants associated with TOXO in the two population samples, the molecular pathways for TOXO susceptibility nevertheless converged on common pathways. Molecular nodes in these common pathways included NOTCH1, CD44, and RXRA. Prior studies show that CD44 participates in TOXO-induced immunopathology and that RXRA is instrumental in regulating T-helper immune responses. These data provide new insights into the pathophysiology of this common neurotropic parasite.	
30604766	Trans-ethnic kidney function association study reveals putative causal genes and effects on kidney-specific disease aetiologies.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects ~10% of the global population, with considerable ethnic differences in prevalence and aetiology. We assemble genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function that defines CKD, in 312,468 individuals of diverse ancestry. We identify 127 distinct association signals with homogeneous effects on eGFR across ancestries and enrichment in genomic annotations including kidney-specific histone modifications. Fine-mapping reveals 40 high-confidence variants driving eGFR associations and highlights putative causal genes with cell-type specific expression in glomerulus, and in proximal and distal nephron. Mendelian randomisation supports causal effects of eGFR on overall and cause-specific CKD, kidney stone formation, diastolic blood pressure and hypertension. These results define novel molecular mechanisms and putative causal genes for eGFR, offering insight into clinical outcomes and routes to CKD treatment development.	
30621171	Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on Bilirubin Concentrations in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome: Sex-Specific GWAS Analysis and Gene-Diet Interactions in a Mediterranean Population.	Although, for decades, increased serum bilirubin concentrations were considered a threatening sign of underlying liver disease and had been associated with neonatal jaundice, data from recent years show that bilirubin is a powerful antioxidant and suggest that slightly increased serum bilirubin concentrations are protective against oxidative stress-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of the gene-diet interactions in determining serum bilirubin concentrations is needed. None of the previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on bilirubin concentrations has been stratified by sex. Therefore, considering the increasing interest in incorporating the gender perspective into nutritional genomics, our main aim was to carry out a GWAS on total serum bilirubin concentrations in a Mediterranean population with metabolic syndrome, stratified by sex. Our secondary aim was to explore, as a pilot study, the presence of gene-diet interactions at the GWAS level. We included 430 participants (188 men and 242 women, aged 55⁻75 years, and with metabolic syndrome) in the PREDIMED Plus-Valencia study. Global and sex-specific GWAS were undertaken to analyze associations and gene-diet interaction on total serum bilirubin. Adherence (low and high) to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was analyzed as the dietary modulator. In the GWAS, we detected more than 55 SNPs associated with serum bilirubin at(p) < 5 × 10(-8) (GWAS level). The top-ranked were four SNPs (rs4148325 ((p) = 9.25 × 10(-24)), rs4148324 ((p) = 9.48 × 10(-24)), rs6742078 ((p) = 1.29 × 10(-23)), rs887829 ((p) = 1.39 × 10(-23)), and the rs4148324 ((p) = 9.48 × 10(-24))) in the UGT1A1 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1) gene, which replicated previous findings revealing the UGT1A1 as the major locus. In the sex-specific GWAS, the top-ranked SNPs at the GWAS level were similar in men and women (the lead SNP was the rs4148324-UGT1A1 in both men ((p) = 4.77 × 10(-11)) and women ((p) = 2.15 × 10(-14)), which shows homogeneous genetic results for the major locus. There was more sex-specific heterogeneity for other minor genes associated at the suggestive level of GWAS significance ((p) < 1 × 10(-5)). We did not detect any gene-MedDiet interaction at(p) < 1 × 10(-5) for the major genetic locus, but we detected some gene-MedDiet interactions with other genes at(p) < 1 × 10(-5), and even at the GWAS level for the IL17B gene ((p) = 3.14 × 10(-8)). These interaction results, however, should be interpreted with caution due to our small sample size. In conclusion, our study provides new data, with a gender perspective, on genes associated with total serum bilirubin concentrations in men and women, and suggests possible additional modulations by adherence to MedDiet.	
30610202	Significant shared heritability underlies suicide attempt and clinically predicted probability of attempting suicide.	Suicide accounts for nearly 800,000 deaths per year worldwide with rates of both deaths and attempts rising. Family studies have estimated substantial heritability of suicidal behavior; however, collecting the sample sizes necessary for successful genetic studies has remained a challenge. We utilized two different approaches in independent datasets to characterize the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. The first is a patient reported suicide attempt phenotype asked as part of an online mental health survey taken by a subset of participants (n = 157,366) in the UK Biobank. After quality control, we leveraged a genotyped set of unrelated, white British ancestry participants including 2433 cases and 334,766 controls that included those that did not participate in the survey or were not explicitly asked about attempting suicide. The second leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC, 2.8 million patients, 3250 cases) and machine learning to derive probabilities of attempting suicide in 24,546 genotyped patients. We identified significant and comparable heritability estimates of suicide attempt from both the patient reported phenotype in the UK Biobank (h(2)(SNP) = 0.035, p = 7.12 × 10(-4)) and the clinically predicted phenotype from VUMC (h(2)(SNP) = 0.046, p = 1.51 × 10(-2)). A significant genetic overlap was demonstrated between the two measures of suicide attempt in these independent samples through polygenic risk score analysis (t = 4.02, p = 5.75 × 10(-5)) and genetic correlation (rg = 1.073, SE = 0.36, p = 0.003). Finally, we show significant but incomplete genetic correlation of suicide attempt with insomnia (rg = 0.34-0.81) as well as several psychiatric disorders (rg = 0.26-0.79). This work demonstrates the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. It points to a genetic underpinning to clinically predicted risk of attempting suicide that is similar to the genetic profile from a patient reported outcome. Lastly, it presents an approach for using EHR data and clinical prediction to generate quantitative measures from binary phenotypes that can improve power for genetic studies.	
30610198	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and lifetime cannabis use: genetic overlap and causality.	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a severely impairing neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence of 5% in children and adolescents and of 2.5% in adults. Comorbid conditions in ADHD play a key role in symptom progression, disorder course and outcome. ADHD is associated with a significantly increased risk for substance use, abuse and dependence. ADHD and cannabis use are partly determined by genetic factors; the heritability of ADHD is estimated at 70-80% and of cannabis use initiation at 40-48%. In this study, we used summary statistics from the largest available meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADHD (n = 53,293) and lifetime cannabis use (n = 32,330) to gain insights into the genetic overlap and causal relationship of these two traits. We estimated their genetic correlation to be r(2) = 0.29 (P = 1.63 × 10(-5)) and identified four new genome-wide significant loci in a cross-trait analysis: two in a single variant association analysis (rs145108385, P = 3.30 × 10(-8) and rs4259397, P = 4.52 × 10(-8)) and two in a gene-based association analysis (WDPCP, P = 9.67 × 10(-7) and ZNF251, P = 1.62 × 10(-6)). Using a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach we found support that ADHD is causal for lifetime cannabis use, with an odds ratio of 7.9 for cannabis use in individuals with ADHD in comparison to individuals without ADHD (95% CI (3.72, 15.51), P = 5.88 × 10(-5)). These results substantiate the temporal relationship between ADHD and future cannabis use and reinforce the need to consider substance misuse in the context of ADHD in clinical interventions.	
30617275	Meta-analysis of up to 622,409 individuals identifies 40 novel smoking behaviour associated genetic loci.	Smoking is a major heritable and modifiable risk factor for many diseases, including cancer, common respiratory disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Fourteen genetic loci have previously been associated with smoking behaviour-related traits. We tested up to 235,116 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on the exome-array for association with smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, pack-years, and smoking cessation in a fixed effects meta-analysis of up to 61 studies (up to 346,813 participants). In a subset of 112,811 participants, a further one million SNVs were also genotyped and tested for association with the four smoking behaviour traits. SNV-trait associations with P < 5 × 10(-8) in either analysis were taken forward for replication in up to 275,596 independent participants from UK Biobank. Lastly, a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication studies was performed. Sixteen SNVs were associated with at least one of the smoking behaviour traits (P < 5 × 10(-8)) in the discovery samples. Ten novel SNVs, including rs12616219 near TMEM182, were followed-up and five of them (rs462779 in REV3L, rs12780116 in CNNM2, rs1190736 in GPR101, rs11539157 in PJA1, and rs12616219 near TMEM182) replicated at a Bonferroni significance threshold (P < 4.5 × 10(-3)) with consistent direction of effect. A further 35 SNVs were associated with smoking behaviour traits in the discovery plus replication meta-analysis (up to 622,409 participants) including a rare SNV, rs150493199, in CCDC141 and two low-frequency SNVs in CEP350 and HDGFRP2. Functional follow-up implied that decreased expression of REV3L may lower the probability of smoking initiation. The novel loci will facilitate understanding the genetic aetiology of smoking behaviour and may lead to the identification of potential drug targets for smoking prevention and/or cessation.	
30617256	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new loci and functional pathways influencing Alzheimer's disease risk.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci. Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (r(g) = 0.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD.	
30626913	Bivariate genome-wide association analyses of the broad depression phenotype combined with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia reveal eight novel genetic loci for depression.	Although a genetic basis of depression has been well established in twin studies, identification of genome-wide significant loci has been difficult. We hypothesized that bivariate analyses of findings from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (meta-GWASs) of the broad depression phenotype with those from meta-GWASs of self-reported and recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder and schizophrenia would enhance statistical power to identify novel genetic loci for depression. LD score regression analyses were first used to estimate the genetic correlations of broad depression with self-reported MDD, recurrent MDD, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Then, we performed four bivariate GWAS analyses. The genetic correlations (r(g) ± SE) of broad depression with self-reported MDD, recurrent MDD, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were 0.79 ± 0.07, 0.24 ± 0.08, 0.53 ± 0.09 and 0.57 ± 0.05, respectively. From a total of 20 independent genome-wide significant loci, 13 loci replicated of which 8 were novel for depression. These were MUC21 for the broad depression phenotype with self-reported MDD and ZNF804A, MIR3143, PSORS1C2, STK19, SPATA31D1, RTN1 and TCF4 for the broad depression phenotype with schizophrenia. Post-GWAS functional analyses of these loci revealed their potential biological involvement in psychiatric disorders. Our results emphasize the genetic similarities among different psychiatric disorders and indicate that cross-disorder analyses may be the best way forward to accelerate gene finding for depression, or psychiatric disorders in general.	
30636644	Genome-wide analysis of genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease and related sex disparities.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. AD is mainly considered a complex disorder with polygenic inheritance. Despite discovering many susceptibility loci, a major proportion of AD genetic variance remains to be explained. We investigated the genetic architecture of AD in four publicly available independent datasets through genome-wide association, transcriptome-wide association, and gene-based and pathway-based analyses. To explore differences in the genetic basis of AD between males and females, analyses were performed on three samples in each dataset: males and females combined, only males, or only females. Our genome-wide association analyses corroborated the associations of several previously detected AD loci and revealed novel significant associations of 35 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) outside the chromosome 19q13 region at the suggestive significance level of p < 5E-06. These SNPs were mapped to 21 genes in 19 chromosomal regions. Of these, 17 genes were not associated with AD at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations by previous genome-wide association studies. Also, the chromosomal regions corresponding to 8 genes did not contain any previously detected AD-associated SNPs with p < 5E-06. Our transcriptome-wide association and gene-based analyses revealed that 26 genes located in 20 chromosomal regions outside chromosome 19q13 had evidence of potential associations with AD at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Of these, 13 genes/regions did not contain any previously AD-associated SNPs at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations. Most of the newly detected AD-associated SNPs and genes were sex specific, indicating sex disparities in the genetic basis of AD. Also, 7 of 26 pathways that showed evidence of associations with AD in our pathway-bases analyses were significant only in females. Our findings, particularly the newly discovered sex-specific genetic contributors, provide novel insight into the genetic architecture of AD and can advance our understanding of its pathogenesis.	
30643251	Association studies of up to 1.2 million individuals yield new insights into the genetic etiology of tobacco and alcohol use.	Tobacco and alcohol use are leading causes of mortality that influence risk for many complex diseases and disorders(1). They are heritable(2,3) and etiologically related(4,5) behaviors that have been resistant to gene discovery efforts(6-11). In sample sizes up to 1.2 million individuals, we discovered 566 genetic variants in 406 loci associated with multiple stages of tobacco use (initiation, cessation, and heaviness) as well as alcohol use, with 150 loci evidencing pleiotropic association. Smoking phenotypes were positively genetically correlated with many health conditions, whereas alcohol use was negatively correlated with these conditions, such that increased genetic risk for alcohol use is associated with lower disease risk. We report evidence for the involvement of many systems in tobacco and alcohol use, including genes involved in nicotinic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission. The results provide a solid starting point to evaluate the effects of these loci in model organisms and more precise substance use measures.	
30643255	A loss-of-function variant in ALOX15 protects against nasal polyps and chronic rhinosinusitis.	Nasal polyps (NP) are lesions on the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa and are a risk factor for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We performed genome-wide association studies on NP and CRS in Iceland and the UK (using UK Biobank data) with 4,366 NP cases, 5,608 CRS cases, and >700,000 controls. We found 10 markers associated with NP and 2 with CRS. We also tested 210 markers reported to associate with eosinophil count, yielding 17 additional NP associations. Of the 27 NP signals, 7 associate with CRS and 13 with asthma. Most notably, a missense variant in ALOX15 that causes a p.Thr560Met alteration in arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) confers large genome-wide significant protection against NP (P = 8.0 × 10(-27), odds ratio = 0.32; 95% confidence interval = 0.26, 0.39) and CRS (P = 1.1 × 10(-8), odds ratio = 0.64; 95% confidence interval = 0.55, 0.75). p.Thr560Met, carried by around 1 in 20 Europeans, was previously shown to cause near total loss of 15-LO enzymatic activity. Our findings identify 15-LO as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in NP and CRS.	
30693016	Genome-Wide Gene-Environment Interaction Analysis Using Set-Based Association Tests.	The identification of gene-environment interactions (G × E) may eventually guide health-related choices and medical interventions for complex diseases. More powerful methods must be developed to identify G × E. The "adaptive combination of Bayes factors method" (ADABF) has been proposed as a powerful genome-wide polygenic approach to detect G × E. In this work, we evaluate its performance when serving as a gene-based G × E test. We compare ADABF with six tests including the "Set-Based gene-EnviRonment InterAction test" (SBERIA), "gene-environment set association test" (GESAT), etc. With extensive simulations, SBERIA and ADABF are found to be more powerful than other G × E tests. However, SBERIA suffers from a power loss when 50% SNP main effects are in the same direction with the SNP × E interaction effects while 50% are in the opposite direction. We further applied these seven G × E methods to the Taiwan Biobank data to explore gene× alcohol interactions on blood pressure levels. The(ADAMTS7P1) gene at chromosome 15q25.2 was detected to interact with alcohol consumption on diastolic blood pressure ((p) = 9.5 × 10(-7), according to the GESAT test). At this gene, the(P)-values provided by other six tests all reached the suggestive significance level ((p) < 5 × 10(-5)). Regarding the computation time required for a genome-wide G × E analysis, SBERIA is the fastest method, followed by ADABF. Considering the validity, power performance, robustness, and computation time, ADABF is recommended for genome-wide G × E analyses.	
30643256	Multivariate genome-wide analyses of the well-being spectrum.	We introduce two novel methods for multivariate genome-wide-association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of related traits that correct for sample overlap. A broad range of simulation scenarios supports the added value of our multivariate methods relative to univariate GWAMA. We applied the novel methods to life satisfaction, positive affect, neuroticism, and depressive symptoms, collectively referred to as the well-being spectrum (N(obs) = 2,370,390), and found 304 significant independent signals. Our multivariate approaches resulted in a 26% increase in the number of independent signals relative to the four univariate GWAMAs and in an ~57% increase in the predictive power of polygenic risk scores. Supporting transcriptome- and methylome-wide analyses (TWAS and MWAS, respectively) uncovered an additional 17 and 75 independent loci, respectively. Bioinformatic analyses, based on gene expression in brain tissues and cells, showed that genes differentially expressed in the subiculum and GABAergic interneurons are enriched in their effect on the well-being spectrum.	
30643258	Genome-wide association analyses of risk tolerance and risky behaviors in over 1 million individuals identify hundreds of loci and shared genetic influences.	Humans vary substantially in their willingness to take risks. In a combined sample of over 1 million individuals, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of general risk tolerance, adventurousness, and risky behaviors in the driving, drinking, smoking, and sexual domains. Across all GWAS, we identified hundreds of associated loci, including 99 loci associated with general risk tolerance. We report evidence of substantial shared genetic influences across risk tolerance and the risky behaviors: 46 of the 99 general risk tolerance loci contain a lead SNP for at least one of our other GWAS, and general risk tolerance is genetically correlated ([Formula: see text] ~ 0.25 to 0.50) with a range of risky behaviors. Bioinformatics analyses imply that genes near SNPs associated with general risk tolerance are highly expressed in brain tissues and point to a role for glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. We found no evidence of enrichment for genes previously hypothesized to relate to risk tolerance.	
30643196	POGLUT1, the putative effector gene driven by rs2293370 in primary biliary cholangitis susceptibility locus chromosome 3q13.33.	Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic and cholestatic autoimmune liver disease caused by the destruction of intrahepatic small bile ducts. Our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified six susceptibility loci for PBC. Here, in order to further elucidate the genetic architecture of PBC, a GWAS was performed on an additional independent sample set, then a genome-wide meta-analysis with our previous GWAS was performed based on a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) imputation analysis of a total of 4,045 Japanese individuals (2,060 cases and 1,985 healthy controls). A susceptibility locus on chromosome 3q13.33 (including ARHGAP31, TMEM39A, POGLUT1, TIMMDC1, and CD80) was previously identified both in the European and Chinese populations and was replicated in the Japanese population (OR = 0.7241, P = 3.5 × 10(-9)). Subsequent in silico and in vitro functional analyses identified rs2293370, previously reported as the top-hit SNP in this locus in the European population, as the primary functional SNP. Moreover, e-QTL analysis indicated that the effector gene of rs2293370 was Protein O-Glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1) (P = 3.4 × 10(-8)). This is the first study to demonstrate that POGLUT1 and not CD80 is the effector gene regulated by the primary functional SNP rs2293370, and that increased expression of POGLUT1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC.	
30642921	A genome-wide association study identifies new loci for factor VII and implicates factor VII in ischemic stroke etiology.	Factor VII (FVII) is an important component of the coagulation cascade. Few genetic loci regulating FVII activity and/or levels have been discovered to date. We conducted a meta-analysis of 9 genome-wide association studies of plasma FVII levels (7 FVII activity and 2 FVII antigen) among 27 495 participants of European and African ancestry. Each study performed ancestry-specific association analyses. Inverse variance weighted meta-analysis was performed within each ancestry group and then combined for a(trans)-ancestry meta-analysis. Our primary analysis included the 7 studies that measured FVII activity, and a secondary analysis included all 9 studies. We provided functional genomic validation for newly identified significant loci by silencing candidate genes in a human liver cell line (HuH7) using small-interfering RNA and then measuring(F7) messenger RNA and FVII protein expression. Lastly, we used meta-analysis results to perform Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of FVII activity on coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke (IS), and venous thromboembolism. We identified 2 novel ((REEP3) and(JAZF1-AS1)) and 6 known loci associated with FVII activity, explaining 19.0% of the phenotypic variance. Adding FVII antigen data to the meta-analysis did not result in the discovery of further loci. Silencing(REEP3) in HuH7 cells upregulated FVII, whereas silencing(JAZF1) downregulated FVII. Mendelian randomization analyses suggest that FVII activity has a positive causal effect on the risk of IS. Variants at(REEP3) and(JAZF1) contribute to FVII activity by regulating(F7) expression levels. FVII activity appears to contribute to the etiology of IS in the general population.	
30649302	Genome-wide association study of anti-Müllerian hormone levels in pre-menopausal women of late reproductive age and relationship with genetic determinants of reproductive lifespan.	Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is required for sexual differentiation in the fetus, and in adult females AMH is produced by growing ovarian follicles. Consequently, AMH levels are correlated with ovarian reserve, declining towards menopause when the oocyte pool is exhausted. A previous genome-wide association study identified three genetic variants in and around the AMH gene that explained 25% of variation in AMH levels in adolescent males but did not identify any genetic associations reaching genome-wide significance in adolescent females. To explore the role of genetic variation in determining AMH levels in women of late reproductive age, we carried out a genome-wide meta-analysis in 3344 pre-menopausal women from five cohorts (median age 44-48 years at blood draw). A single genetic variant, rs16991615, previously associated with age at menopause, reached genome-wide significance at P = 3.48 × 10-10, with a per allele difference in age-adjusted inverse normal AMH of 0.26 standard deviations (SD) (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.18,0.34]). We investigated whether genetic determinants of female reproductive lifespan were more generally associated with pre-menopausal AMH levels. Genetically-predicted age at menarche had no robust association but genetically-predicted age at menopause was associated with lower AMH levels by 0.18 SD (95% CI [0.14,0.21]) in age-adjusted inverse normal AMH per one-year earlier age at menopause. Our findings provide genetic support for the well-established use of AMH as a marker of ovarian reserve.	
30647433	A genome-wide association study in individuals of African ancestry reveals the importance of the Duffy-null genotype in the assessment of clozapine-related neutropenia.	Individuals of African ancestry in the United States and Europe are at increased risk of developing schizophrenia and have poorer clinical outcomes. The antipsychotic clozapine, the only licensed medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, is under-prescribed and has high rates of discontinuation in individuals of African ancestry, due in part to increased rates of neutropenia. The genetic basis of lower neutrophil levels in those of African ancestry has not previously been investigated in the context of clozapine treatment. We sought to identify risk alleles in the first genome-wide association study of neutrophil levels during clozapine treatment, in 552 individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and robustly inferred African genetic ancestry. Two genome-wide significant loci were associated with low neutrophil counts during clozapine treatment. The most significantly associated locus was driven by rs2814778 (β = -0.9, P = 4.21 × 10(-21)), a known regulatory variant in the atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1) gene. Individuals homozygous for the C allele at rs2814778 were significantly more likely to develop neutropenia and have to stop clozapine treatment (OR = 20.4, P = 3.44 × 10(-7)). This genotype, also termed "Duffy-null", has previously been shown to be associated with lower neutrophil levels in those of African ancestry. Our results indicate the relevance of the rs2814778 genotype for those taking clozapine and its potential as a pharmacogenetic test, dependent on the outcome of additional safety studies, to assist decision making in the initiation and on-going management of clozapine treatment.	
30648747	Anastrozole Aromatase Inhibitor Plasma Drug Concentration Genome-Wide Association Study: Functional Epistatic Interaction Between SLC38A7 and ALPPL2.	Anastrozole is a widely prescribed aromatase inhibitor for the therapy of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for plasma anastrozole concentrations in 687 postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. The top single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signal mapped across SLC38A7 (rs11648166, P = 2.3E-08), which we showed to encode an anastrozole influx transporter. The second most significant signal (rs28845026, P = 5.4E-08) mapped near ALPPL2 and displayed epistasis with the SLC38A7 signal. Both of these SNPs were cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)s for these genes, and patients homozygous for variant genotypes for both SNPs had the highest drug concentrations, the highest SLC38A7 expression, and the lowest ALPPL2 expression. In summary, our GWAS identified a novel gene encoding an anastrozole transporter, SLC38A7, as well as epistatic interaction between SNPs in that gene and SNPs near ALPPL2 that influenced both the expression of the transporter and anastrozole plasma concentrations.	
30649180	Association of a Schizophrenia-Risk Nonsynonymous Variant With Putamen Volume in Adolescents: A Voxelwise and Genome-Wide Association Study.	Deviation from normal adolescent brain development precedes manifestations of many major psychiatric symptoms. Such altered developmental trajectories in adolescents may be linked to genetic risk for psychopathology. To identify genetic variants associated with adolescent brain structure and explore psychopathologic relevance of such associations. Voxelwise genome-wide association study in a cohort of healthy adolescents aged 14 years and validation of the findings using 4 independent samples across the life span with allele-specific expression analysis of top hits. Group comparison of the identified gene-brain association among patients with schizophrenia, unaffected siblings, and healthy control individuals. This was a population-based, multicenter study combined with a clinical sample that included participants from the IMAGEN cohort, Saguenay Youth Study, Three-City Study, and Lieber Institute for Brain Development sample cohorts and UK biobank who were assessed for both brain imaging and genetic sequencing. Clinical samples included patients with schizophrenia and unaffected siblings of patients from the Lieber Institute for Brain Development study. Data were analyzed between October 2015 and April 2018. Gray matter volume was assessed by neuroimaging and genetic variants were genotyped by Illumina BeadChip. The discovery sample included 1721 adolescents (873 girls [50.7%]), with a mean (SD) age of 14.44 (0.41) years. The replication samples consisted of 8690 healthy adults (4497 women [51.8%]) from 4 independent studies across the life span. A nonsynonymous genetic variant (minor T allele of rs13107325 in SLC39A8, a gene implicated in schizophrenia) was associated with greater gray matter volume of the putamen (variance explained of 4.21% in the left hemisphere; 8.66; 95% CI, 6.59-10.81; P = 5.35 × 10-18; and 4.44% in the right hemisphere; t = 8.90; 95% CI, 6.75-11.19; P = 6.80 × 10-19) and also with a lower gene expression of SLC39A8 specifically in the putamen (t127 = -3.87; P = 1.70 × 10-4). The identified association was validated in samples across the life span but was significantly weakened in both patients with schizophrenia (z = -3.05; P = .002; n = 157) and unaffected siblings (z = -2.08; P = .04; n = 149). Our results show that a missense mutation in gene SLC39A8 is associated with larger gray matter volume in the putamen and that this association is significantly weakened in schizophrenia. These results may suggest a role for aberrant ion transport in the etiology of psychosis and provide a target for preemptive developmental interventions aimed at restoring the functional effect of this mutation.	
30655502	Genetic associations with suicide attempt severity and genetic overlap with major depression.	In 2015, ~800,000 people died by suicide worldwide. For every death by suicide there are as many as 25 suicide attempts, which can result in serious injury even when not fatal. Despite this large impact on morbidity and mortality, the genetic influences on suicide attempt are poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of severity of suicide attempts to investigate genetic influences. A discovery GWAS was performed in Yale-Penn sample cohorts of European Americans (EAs, n = 2,439) and African Americans (AAs, n = 3,881). We found one genome-wide significant (GWS) signal in EAs near the gene LDHB (rs1677091, p = 1.07 × 10(-8)) and three GWS associations in AAs: ARNTL2 on chromosome 12 (rs683813, p = 2.07 × 10(-8)), FAH on chromosome 15 (rs72740082, p = 2.36 × 10(-8)), and on chromosome 18 (rs11876255, p = 4.61 × 10(-8)) in the Yale-Penn discovery sample. We conducted a limited replication analysis in the completely independent Army-STARRS cohorts. rs1677091 replicated in Latinos (LAT, p = 6.52 × 10(-3)). A variant in LD with FAH rs72740082 (rs72740088; r(2) = 0.68) was replicated in AAs (STARRS AA p = 5.23 × 10(-3); AA meta, 1.51 × 10(-9)). When combined for a trans-population meta-analysis, the final sample size included n = 20,153 individuals. Finally, we found significant genetic overlap with major depressive disorder (MDD) using polygenic risk scores from a large GWAS (r(2) = 0.007, p = 6.42 × 10(-5)). To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS of suicide attempt severity. We identified GWS associations near genes involved in anaerobic energy production (LDHB), circadian clock regulation (ARNTL2), and catabolism of tyrosine (FAH). These findings provide evidence of genetic risk factors for suicide attempt severity, providing new information regarding the molecular mechanisms involved.	
30868120	A genome-wide association study of sodium levels and drug metabolism in an epilepsy cohort treated with carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine.	To ascertain the clinical and genetic factors contributing to carbamazepine- and oxcarbazepine-induced hyponatremia (COIH), and to carbamazepine (CBZ) metabolism, in a retrospectively collected, cross-sectional cohort of people with epilepsy. We collected data on serum sodium levels and antiepileptic drug levels in people with epilepsy attending a tertiary epilepsy center while on treatment with CBZ or OXC. We defined hyponatremia as Na+ ≤134 mEq/L. We estimated the CBZ metabolic ratio defined as the log transformation of the ratio of metabolite CBZ-diol to unchanged drug precursor substrate as measured in serum. Clinical and genetic data relating to carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine trials were collected in 1141 patients. We did not observe any genome-wide significant associations with sodium level in a linear trend or hyponatremia as a dichotomous trait. Age, sex, number of comedications, phenytoin use, phenobarbital use, and sodium valproate use were significant predictors of CBZ metabolic ratio. No genome-wide significant associations with CBZ metabolic ratio were found. Although we did not detect a genetic predictor of hyponatremia or CBZ metabolism in our cohort, our findings suggest that the determinants of CBZ metabolism are multifactorial.	
30659259	Genetic basis for plasma amino acid concentrations based on absolute quantification: a genome-wide association study in the Japanese population.	To assess the use of plasma free amino acids (PFAAs) as biomarkers for metabolic disorders, it is essential to identify genetic factors that influence PFAA concentrations. PFAA concentrations were absolutely quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using plasma samples from 1338 Japanese individuals, and genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed for the concentrations of 21 PFAAs. We next conducted a conditional QTL analysis using the concentration of each PFAA adjusted by the other 20 PFAAs as covariates to elucidate genetic determinants that influence PFAA concentrations. We identified eight genes that showed a significant association with PFAA concentrations, of which two, SLC7A2 and PKD1L2, were identified. SLC7A2 was associated with the plasma levels of arginine and ornithine, and PKD1L2 with the level of glycine. The significant associations of these two genes were revealed in the conditional QTL analysis, but a significant association between serine and the CPS1 gene disappeared when glycine was used as a covariate. We demonstrated that conditional QTL analysis is useful for determining the metabolic pathways predominantly used for PFAA metabolism. Our findings will help elucidate the physiological roles of genetic components that control the metabolism of amino acids.	
30659137	Genetic variation in 	To identify novel genetic associations with white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of WMH volumes in 11,226 individuals, including 8,429 population-based individuals from UK Biobank and 2,797 stroke patients. Replication of novel loci was performed in an independent dataset of 1,202 individuals. In all studies, WMH were quantified using validated automated or semi-automated methods. Imputation was to either the Haplotype Reference Consortium or 1,000 Genomes Phase 3 panels. We identified a locus at genome-wide significance in an intron of(PLEKHG1) (rs275350, β [SE] = 0.071 [0.013];(p) = 1.6 × 10(-8)), a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is involved in reorientation of cells in the vascular endothelium. This association was validated in an independent sample (overall(p) value, 2.4 × 10(-9)). The same single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with all ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.07 [1.03-1.12],(p) = 0.00051), most strongly with the small vessel subtype (OR [95% CI] 1.09 [1.00-1.19],(p) = 0.044). Previous associations at 17q25 and 2p16 reached genome-wide significance in this analysis (rs3744020; β [SE] = 0.106 [0.016];(p) = 1.2 × 10(-11) and rs7596872; β [SE] = 0.143 [0.021];(p) = 3.4 × 10(-12)). All identified associations with WMH to date explained 1.16% of the trait variance in UK Biobank, equivalent to 6.4% of the narrow-sense heritability. Genetic variation in(PLEKHG1) is associated with WMH and ischemic stroke, most strongly with the small vessel subtype, suggesting it acts by promoting small vessel arteriopathy.	
30657218	Longitudinal analysis to better characterize Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome: Findings from an adult asthma cohort in Korea (COREA).	Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS), which has received much attention, has not been unanimously defined. In this study, we tried to demonstrate that longitudinally defined ACOS is more useful in the real world than blending patients with asthma and COPD. The study patients had undergone two consecutive pulmonary function tests measured at least 3 months apart (n = 1889). We selected the patients who had positive bronchodilator response or methacholine provocation tests (n = 959). Next, we defined ACOS as a patient with a persistent airflow obstruction [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity <0.7] that was identified twice consecutively by an interval of at least 3 months (n = 228). The proportions of patients who were older, male and smokers were significantly higher, and baseline lung function was lower in patients with ACOS. In the longitudinal analysis, the mean change in lung function was high, and a greater decline in FEV1 was observed in patients with ACOS. In addition, we compared ACOS and severe asthma, and we also performed a cluster analysis and compared the results with our definition of ACOS. According to our definition, ACOS is an independent subtype with distinctive characteristics. Finally, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify genetic variations associated with ACOS, but no significant single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. Our findings suggest that ACOS should be defined longitudinally and considered as an independent subgroup distinguished by inherited environmental factors rather than as a genetically distinct independent group.	
30659475	A Potential Role for the STXBP5-AS1 Gene in Adult ADHD Symptoms.	We aimed to detect Attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) risk-conferring genes in adults. In children, ADHD is characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity and may persists into adulthood. Childhood and adulthood ADHD are heritable, and are thought to represent the clinical extreme of a continuous distribution of ADHD symptoms in the general population. We aimed to leverage the power of studies of quantitative ADHD symptoms in adults who were genotyped. Within the SAGA (Study of ADHD trait genetics in adults) consortium, we estimated the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of quantitative self-reported ADHD symptoms and carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis in nine adult population-based and case-only cohorts of adults. A total of n = 14,689 individuals were included. In two of the SAGA cohorts we found a significant SNP-based heritability for self-rated ADHD symptom scores of respectively 15% (n = 3656) and 30% (n = 1841). The top hit of the genome-wide meta-analysis (SNP rs12661753; p-value = 3.02 × 10(-7)) was present in the long non-coding RNA gene STXBP5-AS1. This association was also observed in a meta-analysis of childhood ADHD symptom scores in eight population-based pediatric cohorts from the Early Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology (EAGLE) ADHD consortium (n = 14,776). Genome-wide meta-analysis of the SAGA and EAGLE data (n = 29,465) increased the strength of the association with the SNP rs12661753. In human HEK293 cells, expression of STXBP5-AS1 enhanced the expression of a reporter construct of STXBP5, a gene known to be involved in "SNAP" (Soluble NSF attachment protein) Receptor" (SNARE) complex formation. In mouse strains featuring different levels of impulsivity, transcript levels in the prefrontal cortex of the mouse ortholog Gm28905 strongly correlated negatively with motor impulsivity as measured in the five choice serial reaction time task (r(2) = - 0.61; p = 0.004). Our results are consistent with an effect of the STXBP5-AS1 gene on ADHD symptom scores distribution and point to a possible biological mechanism, other than antisense RNA inhibition, involved in ADHD-related impulsivity levels.	
30713548	A Sex-Stratified Genome-Wide Association Study of Tuberculosis Using a Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array.	Tuberculosis (TB), caused by(Mycobacterium tuberculosis), is a complex disease with a known human genetic component. Males seem to be more affected than females and in most countries the TB notification rate is twice as high in males than in females. While socio-economic status, behavior and sex hormones influence the male bias they do not fully account for it. Males have only one copy of the X chromosome, while diploid females are subject to X chromosome inactivation. In addition, the X chromosome codes for many immune-related genes, supporting the hypothesis that X-linked genes could contribute to TB susceptibility in a sex-biased manner. We report the first TB susceptibility genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a specific focus on sex-stratified autosomal analysis and the X chromosome. A total of 810 individuals (410 cases and 405 controls) from an admixed South African population were genotyped using the Illumina Multi Ethnic Genotyping Array, specifically designed as a suitable platform for diverse and admixed populations. Association testing was done on the autosome (8,27,386 variants) and X chromosome (20,939 variants) in a sex stratified and combined manner. SNP association testing was not statistically significant using a stringent cut-off for significance but revealed likely candidate genes that warrant further investigation. A genome wide interaction analysis detected 16 significant interactions. Finally, the results highlight the importance of sex-stratified analysis as strong sex-specific effects were identified on both the autosome and X chromosome.	
30891314	Studying the effects of haplotype partitioning methods on the RA-associated genomic results from the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) dataset.	The human genome, which includes thousands of genes, represents a big data challenge. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disease with a genetic basis. Many single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association methods partition a genome into haplotype blocks. The aim of this genome wide association study (GWAS) was to select the most appropriate haplotype block partitioning method for the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) dataset. The methods used for the NARAC dataset were the individual SNP approach and the following haplotype block methods: the four-gamete test (FGT), confidence interval test (CIT), and solid spine of linkage disequilibrium (SSLD). The measured parameters that reflect the strength of the association between the biomarker and RA were the(P)-value after Bonferroni correction and other parameters used to compare the output of each haplotype block method. This work presents a comparison among the individual SNP approach and the three haplotype block methods to select the method that can detect all the significant SNPs when applied alone. The GWAS results from the NARAC dataset obtained with the different methods are presented. The individual SNP, CIT, FGT, and SSLD methods detected 541, 1516, 1551, and 1831 RA-associated SNPs respectively, and the individual SNP, FGT, CIT, and SSLD methods detected 65, 156, 159, and 450 significant SNPs respectively, that were not detected by the other methods. Three hundred eighty-three SNPs were discovered by the haplotype block methods and the individual SNP approach, while 1021 SNPs were discovered by all three haplotype block methods. The 383 SNPs detected by all the methods are promising candidates for studying RA susceptibility. A hybrid technique involving all four methods should be applied to detect the significant SNPs associated with RA in the NARAC dataset, but the SSLD method may be preferred because of its advantages when only one method was used.	
30661239	Drug-Induced Liver Injury due to Flucloxacillin: Relevance of Multiple Human Leukocyte Antigen Alleles.	Some patients prescribed flucloxacillin (~ 0.01%) develop drug-induced liver injury (DILI). HLA-B*57:01 is an established genetic risk factor for flucloxacillin DILI. To consolidate this finding, identify additional genetic factors, and assess relevance of risk factors for flucloxacillin DILI in relation to DILI due to other penicillins, we performed a genomewide association study involving 197 flucloxacillin DILI cases and 6,835 controls. We imputed single-nucleotide polymorphism and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes. HLA-B*57:01 was the major risk factor (allelic odds ratio (OR) = 36.62; P = 2.67 × 10(-97) ). HLA-B*57:03 also showed an association (OR = 79.21; P = 1.2 × 10(-6) ). Within the HLA-B protein sequence, imputation showed valine(97) , common to HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*57:03, had the largest effect (OR = 38.1; P = 9.7 × 10(-97) ). We found no HLA-B*57 association with DILI due to other isoxazolyl penicillins (n = 6) or amoxicillin (n = 15) and no significant non-HLA signals for any penicillin-related DILI.	
30664634	Genome-wide association study of body fat distribution identifies adiposity loci and sex-specific genetic effects.	Body mass and body fat composition are of clinical interest due to their links to cardiovascular- and metabolic diseases. Fat stored in the trunk has been suggested to be more pathogenic compared to fat stored in other compartments. In this study, we perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the proportion of body fat distributed to the arms, legs and trunk estimated from segmental bio-electrical impedance analysis (sBIA) for 362,499 individuals from the UK Biobank. 98 independent associations with body fat distribution are identified, 29 that have not previously been associated with anthropometric traits. A high degree of sex-heterogeneity is observed and the effects of 37 associated variants are stronger in females compared to males. Our findings also implicate that body fat distribution in females involves mesenchyme derived tissues and cell types, female endocrine tissues as well as extracellular matrix maintenance and remodeling.	
30664745	Identification of new therapeutic targets for osteoarthritis through genome-wide analyses of UK Biobank data.	Osteoarthritis is the most common musculoskeletal disease and the leading cause of disability globally. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study for osteoarthritis (77,052 cases and 378,169 controls), analyzing four phenotypes: knee osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, knee and/or hip osteoarthritis, and any osteoarthritis. We discovered 64 signals, 52 of them novel, more than doubling the number of established disease loci. Six signals fine-mapped to a single variant. We identified putative effector genes by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) colocalization, fine-mapping, and human rare-disease, animal-model, and osteoarthritis tissue expression data. We found enrichment for genes underlying monogenic forms of bone development diseases, and for the collagen formation and extracellular matrix organization biological pathways. Ten of the likely effector genes, including TGFB1 (transforming growth factor beta 1), FGF18 (fibroblast growth factor 18), CTSK (cathepsin K), and IL11 (interleukin 11), have therapeutics approved or in clinical trials, with mechanisms of action supportive of evaluation for efficacy in osteoarthritis.	
30664655	A GWAS in Latin Americans highlights the convergent evolution of lighter skin pigmentation in Eurasia.	We report a genome-wide association scan in >6,000 Latin Americans for pigmentation of skin and eyes. We found eighteen signals of association at twelve genomic regions. These include one novel locus for skin pigmentation (in 10q26) and three novel loci for eye pigmentation (in 1q32, 20q13 and 22q12). We demonstrate the presence of multiple independent signals of association in the 11q14 and 15q13 regions (comprising the GRM5/TYR and HERC2/OCA2 genes, respectively) and several epistatic interactions among independently associated alleles. Strongest association with skin pigmentation at 19p13 was observed for an Y182H missense variant (common only in East Asians and Native Americans) in MFSD12, a gene recently associated with skin pigmentation in Africans. We show that the frequency of the derived allele at Y182H is significantly correlated with lower solar radiation intensity in East Asia and infer that MFSD12 was under selection in East Asians, probably after their split from Europeans.	
30670697	Multi-ancestry study of blood lipid levels identifies four loci interacting with physical activity.	Many genetic loci affect circulating lipid levels, but it remains unknown whether lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, modify these genetic effects. To identify lipid loci interacting with physical activity, we performed genome-wide analyses of circulating HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in up to 120,979 individuals of European, African, Asian, Hispanic, and Brazilian ancestry, with follow-up of suggestive associations in an additional 131,012 individuals. We find four loci, in/near CLASP1, LHX1, SNTA1, and CNTNAP2, that are associated with circulating lipid levels through interaction with physical activity; higher levels of physical activity enhance the HDL cholesterol-increasing effects of the CLASP1, LHX1, and SNTA1 loci and attenuate the LDL cholesterol-increasing effect of the CNTNAP2 locus. The CLASP1, LHX1, and SNTA1 regions harbor genes linked to muscle function and lipid metabolism. Our results elucidate the role of physical activity interactions in the genetic contribution to blood lipid levels.	
30674623	Genetic Determinants of Glycated Hemoglobin in Type 1 Diabetes.	Glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) is an important measure of glycemia in diabetes. HbA(1c) is influenced by environmental and genetic factors both in people with and in people without diabetes. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for HbA(1c) in a Finnish type 1 diabetes (T1D) cohort, FinnDiane. Top results were examined for replication in T1D cohorts DCCT/EDIC, WESDR, CACTI, EDC, and RASS, and a meta-analysis was performed. Three SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 13 near relaxin family peptide receptor 2 ((RXFP2)) were associated with HbA(1c) in FinnDiane at genome-wide significance((P) < 5 × 10(-8)). The minor alleles of rs2085277 and rs1360072 were associated with higher HbA(1c) also in the meta-analysis with RASS((P) < 5 × 10(-8)), where these variants had minor allele frequencies ≥1%. Furthermore, these SNPs were associated with HbA(1c) in an East Asian population without diabetes ((P) ≤ 0.013). A weighted genetic risk score created from 55 HbA(1c)-associated variants from the literature was associated with HbA(1c) in FinnDiane but explained only a small amount of variation. Understanding the genetic basis of glycemic control and HbA(1c) may lead to better prevention of diabetes complications.	
30674883	Early-onset autoimmune vitiligo associated with an enhancer variant haplotype that upregulates class II HLA expression.	Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease in which melanocyte destruction causes skin depigmentation, with 49 loci known from previous GWAS. Aiming to define vitiligo subtypes, we discovered that age-of-onset is bimodal; one-third of cases have early onset (mean 10.3 years) and two-thirds later onset (mean 34.0 years). In the early-onset subgroup we found novel association with MHC class II region indel rs145954018, and independent association with the principal MHC class II locus from previous GWAS, represented by rs9271597; greatest association was with rs145954018del-rs9271597A haplotype (P = 2.40 × 10(-86), OR = 8.10). Both rs145954018 and rs9271597 are located within lymphoid-specific enhancers, and the rs145954018del-rs9271597A haplotype is specifically associated with increased expression of HLA-DQB1 mRNA and HLA-DQ protein by monocytes and dendritic cells. Thus, for vitiligo, MHC regulatory variation confers extreme risk, more important than HLA coding variation. MHC regulatory variation may represent a significant component of genetic risk for other autoimmune diseases.	
30679814	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of 30,000 samples identifies seven novel loci for quantitative ECG traits.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of quantitative electrocardiographic (ECG) traits in large consortia have identified more than 130 loci associated with QT interval, QRS duration, PR interval, and heart rate (RR interval). In the current study, we meta-analyzed genome-wide association results from 30,000 mostly Dutch samples on four ECG traits: PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and RR interval. SNP genotype data was imputed using the Genome of the Netherlands reference panel encompassing 19 million SNPs, including millions of rare SNPs (minor allele frequency < 5%). In addition to many known loci, we identified seven novel locus-trait associations: KCND3, NR3C1, and PLN for PR interval, KCNE1, SGIP1, and NFKB1 for QT interval, and ATP2A2 for QRS duration, of which six were successfully replicated. At these seven loci, we performed conditional analyses and annotated significant SNPs (in exons and regulatory regions), demonstrating involvement of cardiac-related pathways and regulation of nearby genes.	
30677029	Genetic architecture of human thinness compared to severe obesity.	The variation in weight within a shared environment is largely attributable to genetic factors. Whilst many genes/loci confer susceptibility to obesity, little is known about the genetic architecture of healthy thinness. Here, we characterise the heritability of thinness which we found was comparable to that of severe obesity (h2 = 28.07 vs 32.33% respectively), although with incomplete genetic overlap (r = -0.49, 95% CI [-0.17, -0.82], p = 0.003). In a genome-wide association analysis of thinness (n = 1,471) vs severe obesity (n = 1,456), we identified 10 loci previously associated with obesity, and demonstrate enrichment for established BMI-associated loci (pbinomial = 3.05x10-5). Simulation analyses showed that different association results between the extremes were likely in agreement with additive effects across the BMI distribution, suggesting different effects on thinness and obesity could be due to their different degrees of extremeness. In further analyses, we detected a novel obesity and BMI-associated locus at PKHD1 (rs2784243, obese vs. thin p = 5.99x10-6, obese vs. controls p = 2.13x10-6 pBMI = 2.3x10-13), associations at loci recently discovered with much larger sample sizes (e.g. FAM150B and PRDM6-CEP120), and novel variants driving associations at previously established signals (e.g. rs205262 at the SNRPC/C6orf106 locus and rs112446794 at the PRDM6-CEP120 locus). Our ability to replicate loci found with much larger sample sizes demonstrates the value of clinical extremes and suggest that characterisation of the genetics of thinness may provide a more nuanced understanding of the genetic architecture of body weight regulation and may inform the identification of potential anti-obesity targets.	
30692554	Variants in ABCG8 and TRAF3 genes confer risk for gallstone disease in admixed Latinos with Mapuche Native American ancestry.	Latin Americans and Chilean Amerindians have the highest prevalence of gallstone disease (GSD) and gallbladder cancer (GBC) in the world. A handful of loci have been associated with GSD in populations of predominantly European ancestry, however, they only explain a small portion of the genetic component of the disease. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for GSD in 1,095 admixed Chilean Latinos with Mapuche Native American ancestry. Disease status was assessed by cholecystectomy or abdominal ultrasonography. Top-10 candidate variants surpassing the suggestive cutoff of P < 1 × 10(-5) in the discovery cohort were genotyped in an independent replication sample composed of 1,643 individuals. Variants with positive replication were further examined in two European GSD populations and a Chilean GBC cohort. We consistently replicated the association of ABCG8 gene with GSD (rs11887534, P = 3.24 × 10(-8), OR = 1.74) and identified TRAF3 (rs12882491, P = 1.11 × 10(-7), OR = 1.40) as a novel candidate gene for the disease in admixed Chilean Latinos. ABCG8 and TRAF3 variants also conferred risk to GBC. Gene expression analyses indicated that TRAF3 was significantly decreased in gallbladder (P = 0.015) and duodenal mucosa (P = 0.001) of GSD individuals compared to healthy controls, where according to GTEx data in the small intestine, the presence of the risk allele contributes to the observed effect. We conclude that ABCG8 and TRAF3 genes are associated with GSD and GBC in admixed Latinos and that decreased TRAF3 levels could enhance gallbladder inflammation as is observed in GSD and GSD-associated GBC.	
30694715	Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Single-Breath Dl	Dl(CO) is a widely used pulmonary function test in clinical practice and a particularly useful measure for assessing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We hypothesized that elucidating genetic determinants of Dl(CO) could lead to better understanding of the genetic architecture of COPD. We estimated the heritability of Dl(CO) using common genetic variants and performed genome-wide association analyses in four cohorts enriched for subjects with COPD (COPDGene [Genetic Epidemiology of COPD], NETT [National Emphysema Treatment Trial], GenKOLS [Genetics of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease study], and TESRA [Treatment of Emphysema With a Gamma-Selective Retinoid Agonist study]) using a combined European ancestry white dataset and a COPDGene African American dataset. We assessed our genome-wide significant and suggestive associations for Dl(CO) in previously reported genome-wide association studies of COPD and related traits. We also characterized associations of known COPD-associated variants and Dl(CO). We estimated the SNP-based heritability of Dl(CO) in the European ancestry white population to be 22% ((P) = 0.0004). We identified three genome-wide significant associations with Dl(CO): variants near(TGFB2),(CHRNA3), and(PDE11A) loci ((P) < 5 × 10(-8)). In addition, 12 loci were suggestively associated with Dl(CO) in European ancestry white ((P) < 1 × 10(-5) in the combined analysis and(P) < 0.05 in both COPDGene and GenKOLS), including variants near(NEGR1),(CADM2),(PCDH7),(RETREG1),(DACT2),(NRG1),(ANKRD18A),(KRT86),(NTN4),(ARHGAP28),(INSR), and(PCBP3). Some Dl(CO)-associated variants were also associated with COPD, emphysema, and/or spirometric values. Among 25 previously reported COPD loci,(TGFB2, CHRNA3/CHRNA5),(FAM13A),(DSP), and(CYP2A6) were associated with Dl(CO) ((P) < 0.001). We identified several genetic loci that were significantly associated with Dl(CO) and characterized effects of known COPD-associated loci on Dl(CO). These results could lead to better understanding of the heterogeneous nature of COPD.	
30696823	Genome-wide association analyses of chronotype in 697,828 individuals provides insights into circadian rhythms.	Being a morning person is a behavioural indicator of a person's underlying circadian rhythm. Using genome-wide data from 697,828 UK Biobank and 23andMe participants we increase the number of genetic loci associated with being a morning person from 24 to 351. Using data from 85,760 individuals with activity-monitor derived measures of sleep timing we find that the chronotype loci associate with sleep timing: the mean sleep timing of the 5% of individuals carrying the most morningness alleles is 25 min earlier than the 5% carrying the fewest. The loci are enriched for genes involved in circadian regulation, cAMP, glutamate and insulin signalling pathways, and those expressed in the retina, hindbrain, hypothalamus, and pituitary. Using Mendelian Randomisation, we show that being a morning person is causally associated with better mental health but does not affect BMI or risk of Type 2 diabetes. This study offers insights into circadian biology and its links to disease in humans.	
30697902	Genome-wide association study of inhaled corticosteroid response in admixed children with asthma.	Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most widely prescribed and effective medication to control asthma symptoms and exacerbations. However, many children still have asthma exacerbations despite treatment, particularly in admixed populations, such as Puerto Ricans and African Americans. A few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in European and Asian populations, and they have demonstrated the importance of the genetic component in ICS response. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with asthma exacerbations in admixed children treated with ICS and to validate previous GWAS findings. A meta-analysis of two GWAS of asthma exacerbations was performed in 1347 admixed children treated with ICS (Hispanics/Latinos and African Americans), analysing 8.7 million genetic variants. Those with P ≤ 5 × 10(-6) were followed up for replication in 1697 asthmatic patients from six European studies. Associations of ICS response described in published GWAS were followed up for replication in the admixed populations. A total of 15 independent variants were suggestively associated with asthma exacerbations in admixed populations (P ≤ 5 × 10(-6) ). One of them, located in the intergenic region of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C, showed evidence of replication in Europeans (rs5995653, P = 7.52 × 10(-3) ) and was also associated with change in lung function after treatment with ICS (P = 4.91 × 10(-3) ). Additionally, the reported association of the L3MBTL4-ARHGAP28 genomic region was confirmed in admixed populations, although a different variant was identified. This study revealed the novel association of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C with asthma exacerbations in children treated with ICS and replicated previously identified genomic regions. This contributes to the current knowledge about the multiple genetic markers determining responsiveness to ICS which could lead in the future the clinical identification of those asthma patients who are not able to respond to such treatment.	
30729179	Identification of 12 genetic loci associated with human healthspan.	Aging populations face diminishing quality of life due to increased disease and morbidity. These challenges call for longevity research to focus on understanding the pathways controlling healthspan. We use the data from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort and observe that the risks of major chronic diseases increased exponentially and double every eight years, i.e., at a rate compatible with the Gompertz mortality law. Assuming that aging drives the acceleration in morbidity rates, we build a risk model to predict the age at the end of healthspan depending on age, gender, and genetic background. Using the sub-population of 300,447 British individuals as a discovery cohort, we identify 12 loci associated with healthspan at the whole-genome significance level. We find strong genetic correlations between healthspan and all-cause mortality, life-history, and lifestyle traits. We thereby conclude that the healthspan offers a promising new way to interrogate the genetics of human longevity.	
30705256	Genome-wide association study identifies a novel locus associated with psychological distress in the Japanese population.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and disabling psychiatric disorder. A recent mega analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified 44 loci associated with MDD, though most of the genetic etiologies of the MDD/psychological distress remain unclear. To further understand the genetic basis of MDD/psychological distress, we conducted a GWAS in East Asia with more than 10,000 participants of Japanese ancestry who had enrolled in a direct-to-consumer genetic test. After quality control on the genotype data, 10,330 subjects with a total of 8,567,708 imputed SNPs were eligible for the analysis. The participants completed a self-administered questionnaire on their past medical history and health conditions that included the 6-item Kessler screening scale (K6 scale) for psychological distress (cut-off point of 5) and past medical history of MDD, resulting in 3981 subjects assigned to "psychologically distressed group" [cases], and the remaining 6349 subjects were assigned to the "non-psychologically distressed group" [controls]. In this GWAS, we found an association with genome-wide significance at rs6073833 (P = 7.60 × 10(-9)) in 20q13.12. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale GWAS for psychological distress using data from direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests in a population of non-European-ancestry, and the present study thus detected a novel locus significantly associated with psychological distress in the Japanese population.	
30700811	Genome-wide association study of antidepressant treatment resistance in a population-based cohort using health service prescription data and meta-analysis with GENDEP.	Antidepressants demonstrate modest response rates in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of antidepressant treatment response, the underlying genetic factors are unknown. Using prescription data in a population and family-based cohort (Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study; GS:SFHS), we sought to define a measure of (a) antidepressant treatment resistance and (b) stages of antidepressant resistance by inferring antidepressant switching as non-response to treatment. GWAS were conducted separately for antidepressant treatment resistance in GS:SFHS and the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study and then meta-analysed (meta-analysis n = 4213, cases = 358). For stages of antidepressant resistance, a GWAS on GS:SFHS only was performed (n = 3452). Additionally, we conducted gene-set enrichment, polygenic risk scoring (PRS) and genetic correlation analysis. We did not identify any significant loci, genes or gene sets associated with antidepressant treatment resistance or stages of resistance. Significant positive genetic correlations of antidepressant treatment resistance and stages of resistance with neuroticism, psychological distress, schizotypy and mood disorder traits were identified. These findings suggest that larger sample sizes are needed to identify the genetic architecture of antidepressant treatment response, and that population-based observational studies may provide a tractable approach to achieving the necessary statistical power.	
30706531	Variation in SIPA1L2 is correlated with phenotype modification in Charcot- Marie- Tooth disease type 1A.	Genetic modifiers in rare disease have long been suspected to contribute to the considerable variance in disease expression, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). To address this question, the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium collected a large standardized sample of such rare CMT1A patients over a period of 8 years. CMT1A is caused in most patients by a uniformly sized 1.5 Mb duplication event involving the gene PMP22. We genotyped DNA samples from 971 CMT1A patients on Illumina BeadChips. Genome-wide analysis was performed in a subset of 330 of these patients, who expressed the extremes of a hallmark symptom: mild and severe foot dorsiflexion strength impairment. SIPA1L2 (signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 like 2), the top identified candidate modifier gene, was expressed in the peripheral nerve, and our functional studies identified and confirmed interacting proteins using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, mass spectrometry, and immunocytochemistry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vitro siRNA experiments were used to analyze gene regulation. We identified significant association of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10910527, rs7536385, rs4649265, rs1547740) in SIPA1L2 with foot dorsiflexion strength (p < 1 × 10(-7) ). Coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy studies identified β-actin and MYH9 as SIPA1L2 binding partners. Furthermore, we show that SIPA1L2 is part of a myelination-associated coexpressed network regulated by the master transcription factor SOX10. Importantly, in vitro knockdown of SIPA1L2 in Schwannoma cells led to a significant reduction of PMP22 expression, hinting at a potential strategy for drug development. SIPA1L2 is a potential genetic modifier of CMT1A phenotypic expressions and offers a new pathway to therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:316-330.	
30704525	A genome-wide association study of mitochondrial DNA copy number in two population-based cohorts.	Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA CN) exhibits interindividual and intercellular variation, but few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of directly assayed mtDNA CN exist. We undertook a GWAS of qPCR-assayed mtDNA CN in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the UK Blood Service (UKBS) cohort. After validating and harmonising data, 5461 ALSPAC mothers (16-43 years at mtDNA CN assay) and 1338 UKBS females (17-69 years) were included in a meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses restricted to females with white cell-extracted DNA and adjusted for estimated or assayed cell proportions. Associations were also explored in ALSPAC children and UKBS males. A neutrophil-associated locus approached genome-wide significance (rs709591 [MED24], β (change in SD units of mtDNA CN per allele) [SE] - 0.084 [0.016], p = 1.54e-07) in the main meta-analysis of adult females. This association was concordant in magnitude and direction in UKBS males and ALSPAC neonates. SNPs in and around ABHD8 were associated with mtDNA CN in ALSPAC neonates (rs10424198, β [SE] 0.262 [0.034], p = 1.40e-14), but not other study groups. In a meta-analysis of unrelated individuals (N = 11,253), we replicated a published association in TFAM (β [SE] 0.046 [0.017], p = 0.006), with an effect size much smaller than that observed in the replication analysis of a previous in silico GWAS. In a hypothesis-generating GWAS, we confirm an association between TFAM and mtDNA CN and present putative loci requiring replication in much larger samples. We discuss the limitations of our work, in terms of measurement error and cellular heterogeneity, and highlight the need for larger studies to better understand nuclear genomic control of mtDNA copy number.	
30794219	The 2018 Otto Aufranc Award: How Does Genome-wide Variation Affect Osteolysis Risk After THA?	Periprosthetic osteolysis resulting in aseptic loosening is a leading cause of THA revision. Individuals vary in their susceptibility to osteolysis and heritable factors may contribute to this variation. However, the overall contribution that such variation makes to osteolysis risk is unknown. We conducted two genome-wide association studies to (1) identify genetic risk loci associated with susceptibility to osteolysis; and (2) identify genetic risk loci associated with time to prosthesis revision for osteolysis. The Norway cohort comprised 2624 patients after THA recruited from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Registry, of whom 779 had undergone revision surgery for osteolysis. The UK cohort included 890 patients previously recruited from hospitals in the north of England, 317 who either had radiographic evidence of and/or had undergone revision surgery for osteolysis. All participants had received a fully cemented or hybrid THA using a small-diameter metal or ceramic-on-conventional polyethylene bearing. Osteolysis susceptibility case-control analyses and quantitative trait analyses for time to prosthesis revision (a proxy measure of the speed of osteolysis onset) in those patients with osteolysis were undertaken in each cohort separately after genome-wide genotyping. Finally, a meta-analysis of the two independent cohort association analysis results was undertaken. Genome-wide association analysis identified four independent suggestive genetic signals for osteolysis case-control status in the Norwegian cohort and 11 in the UK cohort (p ≤ 5 x 10). After meta-analysis, five independent genetic signals showed a suggestive association with osteolysis case-control status at p ≤ 5 x 10 with the strongest comprising 18 correlated variants on chromosome 7 (lead signal rs850092, p = 1.13 x 10). Genome-wide quantitative trait analysis in cases only showed a total of five and nine independent genetic signals for time to revision at p ≤ 5 x 10, respectively. After meta-analysis, 11 independent genetic signals showed suggestive evidence of an association with time to revision at p ≤ 5 x 10 with the largest association block comprising 174 correlated variants in chromosome 15 (lead signal rs10507055, p = 1.40 x 10). We explored the heritable biology of osteolysis at the whole genome level and identify several genetic loci that associate with susceptibility to osteolysis or with premature revision surgery. However, further studies are required to determine a causal association between the identified signals and osteolysis and their functional role in the disease. The identification of novel genetic risk loci for osteolysis enables new investigative avenues for clinical biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention in this disease.	
30718454	Genome-wide by environment interaction studies of depressive symptoms and psychosocial stress in UK Biobank and Generation Scotland.	Stress is associated with poorer physical and mental health. To improve our understanding of this link, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of depressive symptoms and genome-wide by environment interaction studies (GWEIS) of depressive symptoms and stressful life events (SLE) in two UK population-based cohorts (Generation Scotland and UK Biobank). No SNP was individually significant in either GWAS, but gene-based tests identified six genes associated with depressive symptoms in UK Biobank (DCC, ACSS3, DRD2, STAG1, FOXP2 and KYNU; p < 2.77 × 10(-6)). Two SNPs with genome-wide significant GxE effects were identified by GWEIS in Generation Scotland: rs12789145 (53-kb downstream PIWIL4; p = 4.95 × 10(-9); total SLE) and rs17070072 (intronic to ZCCHC2; p = 1.46 × 10(-8); dependent SLE). A third locus upstream CYLC2 (rs12000047 and rs12005200, p < 2.00 × 10(-8); dependent SLE) when the joint effect of the SNP main and GxE effects was considered. GWEIS gene-based tests identified: MTNR1B with GxE effect with dependent SLE in Generation Scotland; and PHF2 with the joint effect in UK Biobank (p < 2.77 × 10(-6)). Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) analyses incorporating GxE effects improved the prediction of depressive symptom scores, when using weights derived from either the UK Biobank GWAS of depressive symptoms (p = 0.01) or the PGC GWAS of major depressive disorder (p = 5.91 × 10(-3)). Using an independent sample, PRS derived using GWEIS GxE effects provided evidence of shared aetiologies between depressive symptoms and schizotypal personality, heart disease and COPD. Further such studies are required and may result in improved treatments for depression and other stress-related conditions.	
30718733	The Korea Biobank Array: Design and Identification of Coding Variants Associated with Blood Biochemical Traits.	We introduce the design and implementation of a new array, the Korea Biobank Array (referred to as KoreanChip), optimized for the Korean population and demonstrate findings from GWAS of blood biochemical traits. KoreanChip comprised >833,000 markers including >247,000 rare-frequency or functional variants estimated from >2,500 sequencing data in Koreans. Of the 833 K markers, 208 K functional markers were directly genotyped. Particularly, >89 K markers were presented in East Asians. KoreanChip achieved higher imputation performance owing to the excellent genomic coverage of 95.38% for common and 73.65% for low-frequency variants. From GWAS (Genome-wide association study) using 6,949 individuals, 28 associations were successfully recapitulated. Moreover, 9 missense variants were newly identified, of which we identified new associations between a common population-specific missense variant, rs671 (p.Glu457Lys) of ALDH2, and two traits including aspartate aminotransferase (P = 5.20 × 10(-13)) and alanine aminotransferase (P = 4.98 × 10(-8)). Furthermore, two novel missense variants of GPT with rare frequency in East Asians but extreme rarity in other populations were associated with alanine aminotransferase (rs200088103; p.Arg133Trp, P = 2.02 × 10(-9) and rs748547625; p.Arg143Cys, P = 1.41 × 10(-6)). These variants were successfully replicated in 6,000 individuals (P = 5.30 × 10(-8) and P = 1.24 × 10(-6)). GWAS results suggest the promising utility of KoreanChip with a substantial number of damaging variants to identify new population-specific disease-associated rare/functional variants.	
30718321	Genome-Wide Association Studies of Impulsive Personality Traits (BIS-11 and UPPS-P) and Drug Experimentation in up to 22,861 Adult Research Participants Identify Loci in the 	Impulsive personality traits are complex heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly drug abuse and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In collaboration with the genetics company 23andMe, we performed 10 genome-wide association studies on measures of impulsive personality traits [the short version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)] and drug experimentation (the number of drug classes an individual had tried in their lifetime) in up to 22,861 male and female adult human research participants of European ancestry. Impulsive personality traits and drug experimentation showed single nucleotide polymorphism heritabilities that ranged from 5 to 11%. Genetic variants in the(CADM2) locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Sensation Seeking ((p) = 8.3 × 10(-9), rs139528938) and showed a suggestive association with Drug Experimentation ((p) = 3.0 × 10(-7), rs2163971;(r)(2) = 0.68 with rs139528938). Furthermore, genetic variants in the(CACNA1I) locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Negative Urgency ((p) = 3.8 × 10(-8); rs199694726). The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. Multiple subscales from both UPPS-P and BIS showed strong genetic correlations (>0.5) with Drug Experimentation and other substance use traits measured in independent cohorts, including smoking initiation, and lifetime cannabis use. Several UPPS-P and BIS subscales were genetically correlated with ADHD ((r)(g) = 0.30-0.51), supporting their validity as endophenotypes. Our findings demonstrate a role for common genetic contributions to individual differences in impulsivity. Furthermore, our study is the first to provide a genetic dissection of the relationship between different types of impulsive personality traits and various psychiatric disorders.(SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT) Impulsive personality traits (IPTs) are heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly substance use disorders. We have performed genome-wide association studies of IPTs to identify regions and genes that account for this heritable variation. IPTs and drug experimentation were modestly heritable (5-11%). We identified an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in(CADM2) and both sensation seeking and drug experimentation; and between variants in(CACNA1I) and negative urgency. The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. This study provides evidence that impulsivity can be genetically separated into distinct components. We showed that IPT are genetically associated with substance use and ADHD, suggesting impulsivity is an endophenotype contributing to these psychiatric conditions.	
30714141	Two novel genetic variants in the STK38L and RAB27A genes are associated with glioma susceptibility.	Glioma is the most common malignant primary brain tumors with poor prognosis. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of glioma in populations with Western European ancestry were completed in the US and UK. However, our previous results strongly suggest the genetic heterogeneity could be important in glioma risk. To systematically investigate glioma risk-associated variants in Chinese population, we performed a multistage GWAS of glioma in the Han Chinese population, with a total of 3,097 glioma cases and 4,362 controls. In addition to confirming two associations reported in other ancestry groups, this study identified one new risk-associated locus for glioma on chromosome 12p11.23 (rs10842893, p(meta) = 2.33x10-12, STK38L) as well as a promising association at 15q15-21.1 (rs4774756, p(meta) = 6.12x10-8, RAB27A) in 3,097 glioma cases and 4,362 controls. Our findings demonstrate two novel association between the glioma risk region marked by variant rs10842893 and rs4774756) and glioma risk. These findings may advance the understanding of genetic susceptibility to glioma.	
30718901	Genome-wide meta-analysis of depression identifies 102 independent variants and highlights the importance of the prefrontal brain regions.	Major depression is a debilitating psychiatric illness that is typically associated with low mood and anhedonia. Depression has a heritable component that has remained difficult to elucidate with current sample sizes due to the polygenic nature of the disorder. To maximize sample size, we meta-analyzed data on 807,553 individuals (246,363 cases and 561,190 controls) from the three largest genome-wide association studies of depression. We identified 102 independent variants, 269 genes, and 15 genesets associated with depression, including both genes and gene pathways associated with synaptic structure and neurotransmission. An enrichment analysis provided further evidence of the importance of prefrontal brain regions. In an independent replication sample of 1,306,354 individuals (414,055 cases and 892,299 controls), 87 of the 102 associated variants were significant after multiple testing correction. These findings advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of depression and provide several future avenues for understanding etiology and developing new treatment approaches.	
30718926	Identification of 28 new susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.	To understand the genetics of type 2 diabetes in people of Japanese ancestry, we conducted A meta-analysis of four genome-wide association studies (GWAS; 36,614 cases and 155,150 controls of Japanese ancestry). We identified 88 type 2 diabetes-associated loci (P < 5.0 × 10(-8)) with 115 independent signals (P < 5.0 × 10(-6)), of which 28 loci with 30 signals were novel. Twenty-eight missense variants were in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) > 0.6) with the lead variants. Among the 28 missense variants, three previously unreported variants had distinct minor allele frequency (MAF) spectra between people of Japanese and European ancestry (MAF(JPN) > 0.05 versus MAF(EUR) < 0.01), including missense variants in genes related to pancreatic acinar cells (GP2) and insulin secretion (GLP1R). Transethnic comparisons of the molecular pathways identified from the GWAS results highlight both ethnically shared and heterogeneous effects of a series of pathways on type 2 diabetes (for example, monogenic diabetes and beta cells).	
30745170	Identification of novel genome-wide associations for suicidality in UK Biobank, genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders and polygenic association with completed suicide.	Suicide is a major issue for global public health. Suicidality describes a broad spectrum of thoughts and behaviours, some of which are common in the general population. Although suicide results from a complex interaction of multiple social and psychological factors, predisposition to suicidality is at least partly genetic. Ordinal genome-wide association study of suicidality in the UK Biobank cohort comparing: 'no suicidality' controls (N = 83,557); 'thoughts that life was not worth living' (N = 21,063); 'ever contemplated self-harm' (N = 13,038); 'act of deliberate self-harm in the past' (N = 2498); and 'previous suicide attempt' (N = 2666). We identified three novel genome-wide significant loci for suicidality (on chromosomes nine, 11 and 13) and moderate-to-strong genetic correlations between suicidality and a range of psychiatric disorders, most notably depression (r(g) 0·81). These findings provide new information about genetic variants relating to increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Future work should assess the extent to which polygenic risk scores for suicidality, in combination with non-genetic risk factors, may be useful for stratified approaches to suicide prevention at a population level.

30738427	A genome-wide association study identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with time-to-metastasis in colorectal cancer.	Differentiating between cancer patients who will experience metastasis within a short time and who will be long-term survivors without metastasis is a critical aim in healthcare. The microsatellite instability (MSI)-high tumor phenotype is such a differentiator in colorectal cancer, as patients with these tumors are unlikely to experience metastasis. Our aim in this study was to determine if germline genetic variations could further differentiate colorectal cancer patients based on the long-term risk and timing of metastasis. The patient cohort consisted of 379 stage I-III Caucasian colorectal cancer patients with microsatellite stable or MSI-low tumors. We performed univariable analysis on 810,622 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) under different genetic models. Depending on the long-term metastasis-free survival probability estimates, we applied a mixture cure model, Cox proportional hazards regression model, or log-rank test. For SNPs reaching Bonferroni-corrected significance (p < 6.2 × 10(- 8)) having valid genetic models, multivariable analysis adjusting for significant baseline characteristics was conducted. After adjusting for significant baseline characteristics, specific genotypes of ten polymorphisms were significantly associated with time-to-metastasis. These polymorphisms are three intergenic SNPs, rs5749032 (p = 1.28 × 10(- 10)), rs2327990 (p = 9.59 × 10(- 10)), rs1145724 (p = 3 × 10(- 8)), and seven SNPs within the non-coding sequences of three genes: FHIT (p = 2.59 × 10(- 9)), EPHB1 (p = 8.23 × 10(- 9)), and MIR7515 (p = 4.87 × 10(- 8)). Our results suggest novel associations of specific genotypes of SNPs with early metastasis in Caucasian colorectal cancer patients. These associations, once replicated in other patient cohorts, could assist in the development of personalized treatment strategies for colorectal cancer patients.
30741946	Genome-wide association scan identifies new variants associated with a cognitive predictor of dyslexia.	Developmental dyslexia (DD) is one of the most prevalent learning disorders, with high impact on school and psychosocial development and high comorbidity with conditions like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety. DD is characterized by deficits in different cognitive skills, including word reading, spelling, rapid naming, and phonology. To investigate the genetic basis of DD, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of these skills within one of the largest studies available, including nine cohorts of reading-impaired and typically developing children of European ancestry (N = 2562-3468). We observed a genome-wide significant effect (p < 1 × 10(-8)) on rapid automatized naming of letters (RANlet) for variants on 18q12.2, within MIR924HG (micro-RNA 924 host gene; rs17663182 p = 4.73 × 10(-9)), and a suggestive association on 8q12.3 within NKAIN3 (encoding a cation transporter; rs16928927, p = 2.25 × 10(-8)). rs17663182 (18q12.2) also showed genome-wide significant multivariate associations with RAN measures (p = 1.15 × 10(-8)) and with all the cognitive traits tested (p = 3.07 × 10(-8)), suggesting (relational) pleiotropic effects of this variant. A polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis revealed significant genetic overlaps of some of the DD-related traits with educational attainment (EDUyears) and ADHD. Reading and spelling abilities were positively associated with EDUyears (p ~ [10(-5)-10(-7)]) and negatively associated with ADHD PRS (p ~ [10(-8)-10(-17)]). This corroborates a long-standing hypothesis on the partly shared genetic etiology of DD and ADHD, at the genome-wide level. Our findings suggest new candidate DD susceptibility genes and provide new insights into the genetics of dyslexia and its comorbities.	
30760885	Biological insights into multiple birth: genetic findings from UK Biobank.	The tendency to conceive spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twins is a complex trait with important contributions from both environmental factors and genetic disposition. In earlier work, we identified the first two genes as maternal susceptibility loci for DZ twinning. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants influencing multiple births and to genetically correlate the findings across a broad range of traits. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8962 participants with Caucasian ancestry from UK Biobank who reported being part of a multiple birth, and 409,591 singleton controls. We replicated the association between FSHB, SMAD3 and twinning in the gene-based (but not SNP-based) test, which had been established in previous genome-wide association analyses in mothers with dizygotic twin offspring. Additionally, we report a novel genetic variant associated with multiple birth, rs428022 at 15q23 (p = 2.84 × 10(-8)) close to two genes: PIAS1 and SKOR1. Finally, we identified meaningful genetic correlations between being part of a multiple birth and other phenotypes (anthropometric traits, health-related traits, and fertility-related measures). The outcomes of this study provide important new insights into the genetic aetiology of multiple births and fertility, and open up novel directions for fertility and reproduction research.	
30767168	Genetic risk score combining six genetic variants associated with the cellular NRF2 expression levels correlates with Type 2 diabetes in the human population.	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is known as an inflammatory disease. NRF2 (Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2 Like2) encodes a transcription factor that binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) and regulates the expression of genes involved in many antioxidant responses. This study aimed to gain insight into individual anti-inflammatory activity to prevent T2D development in humans. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants influencing NRF2 expression in LCLs (lymphoblastoid cell lines) generated from 74 different individuals. Association analyses between T2D or its related traits and genetic risk score (GRS) calculated by combining genetic variants detected from GWAS for cellular NRF2 expression were performed using data from 8715 subjects. The T2D prediction model using GRS was evaluated by measuring the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Our GWAS identified six genetic variants (SNP) showing suggestive evidence of associations with cellular NRF2 expression (P < 10(- 6)). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that GRS was associated with an increased risk of T2D (P value = 0.003, OR = 1.13). In addition, linear regression analyses showed positive associations between GRS and fasting glucose (P value = 0.028, β = 0.62), 2-h glucose (P value = 0.0004, β = 1.13) and HbA1C (P value = 0.033, β = 0.03). In the T2D prediction model using GRS, the AUC of the ROC curve was 0.69. This study highlights genetic variants associated with cellular NRF2 expression and suggests that the GRS of NRF2 expression-associated variants is likely to be a useful indicator of T2D development in the human population.	
30778226	Protein-coding variants implicate novel genes related to lipid homeostasis contributing to body-fat distribution.	Body-fat distribution is a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular health consequences. We analyzed the association of body-fat distribution, assessed by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index, with 228,985 predicted coding and splice site variants available on exome arrays in up to 344,369 individuals from five major ancestries (discovery) and 132,177 European-ancestry individuals (validation). We identified 15 common (minor allele frequency, MAF ≥5%) and nine low-frequency or rare (MAF <5%) coding novel variants. Pathway/gene set enrichment analyses identified lipid particle, adiponectin, abnormal white adipose tissue physiology and bone development and morphology as important contributors to fat distribution, while cross-trait associations highlight cardiometabolic traits. In functional follow-up analyses, specifically in Drosophila RNAi-knockdowns, we observed a significant increase in the total body triglyceride levels for two genes (DNAH10 and PLXND1). We implicate novel genes in fat distribution, stressing the importance of interrogating low-frequency and protein-coding variants.	
30779856	Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies Identifies Three Loci Associated With Stiffness Index of the Calcaneus.	The stiffness index (SI) from quantitative ultrasound measurements is a good indicator of BMD and may be used to predict the risk of osteoporotic fracture. We conducted a genomewide association study (GWAS) for SI using 7742 individuals from the Taiwan Biobank, followed by a replication study in a Korean population (n = 2955). Approximately 6.1 million SNPs were subjected to association analysis, and SI-associated variants were identified. We further conducted a meta-analysis of Taiwan Biobank significant SNPs with a Korean population-based cohort. Candidate genes were prioritized according to epigenetic annotations, gene ontology, protein-protein interaction, GWAS catalog, and expression quantitative trait loci analyses. Our results revealed seven significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within three loci: 7q31.31, 17p13.3, and 11q14.2. Conditional analysis showed that three SNPs, rs2536195 (CPED1/WNT16), rs1231207 (SMG6), and rs4944661 (LOC10050636/TMEM135), were the most important signals within these regions. The associations for the three SNPs were confirmed in a UK Biobank estimated BMD GWAS; these three cytobands were replicated successfully after a meta-analysis with a Korean population cohort as well. However, two SNPs were not replicated. After prioritization, we identified two novel genes, RAB15 and FNTB, as strong candidates for association with SI. Our study identified three SI-associated SNPs and two novel SI-related genes. Overall, these results provide further insight into the genetic architecture of osteoporosis. Further studies in larger East Asian populations are needed. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.	
30787307	Association study in African-admixed populations across the Americas recapitulates asthma risk loci in non-African populations.	Asthma is a complex disease with striking disparities across racial and ethnic groups. Despite its relatively high burden, representation of individuals of African ancestry in asthma genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been inadequate, and true associations in these underrepresented minority groups have been inconclusive. We report the results of a genome-wide meta-analysis from the Consortium on Asthma among African Ancestry Populations (CAAPA; 7009 asthma cases, 7645 controls). We find strong evidence for association at four previously reported asthma loci whose discovery was driven largely by non-African populations, including the chromosome 17q12-q21 locus and the chr12q13 region, a novel (and not previously replicated) asthma locus recently identified by the Trans-National Asthma Genetic Consortium (TAGC). An additional seven loci reported by TAGC show marginal evidence for association in CAAPA. We also identify two novel loci (8p23 and 8q24) that may be specific to asthma risk in African ancestry populations.	
30787463	Genome-wide association study of germline variants and breast cancer-specific mortality.	We examined the associations between germline variants and breast cancer mortality using a large meta-analysis of women of European ancestry. Meta-analyses included summary estimates based on Cox models of twelve datasets using ~10.4 million variants for 96,661 women with breast cancer and 7697 events (breast cancer-specific deaths). Oestrogen receptor (ER)-specific analyses were based on 64,171 ER-positive (4116) and 16,172 ER-negative (2125) patients. We evaluated the probability of a signal to be a true positive using the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP). We did not find any variant associated with breast cancer-specific mortality at P < 5 × 10(-8). For ER-positive disease, the most significantly associated variant was chr7:rs4717568 (BFDP = 7%, P = 1.28 × 10(-7), hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.92); the closest gene is AUTS2. For ER-negative disease, the most significant variant was chr7:rs67918676 (BFDP = 11%, P = 1.38 × 10(-7), HR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.16-1.39); located within a long intergenic non-coding RNA gene (AC004009.3), close to the HOXA gene cluster. We uncovered germline variants on chromosome 7 at BFDP < 15% close to genes for which there is biological evidence related to breast cancer outcome. However, the paucity of variants associated with mortality at genome-wide significance underpins the challenge in providing genetic-based individualised prognostic information for breast cancer patients.	
30796134	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of functional outcome after ischemic stroke.	To discover common genetic variants associated with poststroke outcomes using a genome-wide association (GWA) study. The study comprised 6,165 patients with ischemic stroke from 12 studies in Europe, the United States, and Australia included in the GISCOME (Genetics of Ischaemic Stroke Functional Outcome) network. The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score after 60 to 190 days, evaluated as 2 dichotomous variables (0-2 vs 3-6 and 0-1 vs 2-6) and subsequently as an ordinal variable. GWA analyses were performed in each study independently and results were meta-analyzed. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, stroke severity (baseline NIH Stroke Scale score), and ancestry. The significance level was(p) < 5 × 10(-8). We identified one genetic variant associated with functional outcome with genome-wide significance (modified Rankin Scale scores 0-2 vs 3-6,(p) = 5.3 × 10(-9)). This intronic variant (rs1842681) in the(LOC105372028) gene is a previously reported trans-expression quantitative trait locus for(PPP1R21), which encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1. This ubiquitous phosphatase is implicated in brain functions such as brain plasticity. Several variants detected in this study demonstrated suggestive association with outcome ((p) < 10(-5)), some of which are within or near genes with experimental evidence of influence on ischemic stroke volume and/or brain recovery (e.g.,(NTN4),(TEK), and(PTCH1)). In this large GWA study on functional outcome after ischemic stroke, we report one significant variant and several variants with suggestive association to outcome 3 months after stroke onset with plausible mechanistic links to poststroke recovery. Future replication studies and exploration of potential functional mechanisms for identified genetic variants are warranted.	
30804558	Identification of common genetic risk variants for autism spectrum disorder.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental phenotypes diagnosed in more than 1% of children. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ASD susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with ASD. With a marked sample-size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with ASD and 27,969 controls that identified five genome-wide-significant loci. Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD.	
30804560	New genetic signals for lung function highlight pathways and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associations across multiple ancestries.	Reduced lung function predicts mortality and is key to the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In a genome-wide association study in 400,102 individuals of European ancestry, we define 279 lung function signals, 139 of which are new. In combination, these variants strongly predict COPD in independent populations. Furthermore, the combined effect of these variants showed generalizability across smokers and never smokers, and across ancestral groups. We highlight biological pathways, known and potential drug targets for COPD and, in phenome-wide association studies, autoimmune-related and other pleiotropic effects of lung function-associated variants. This new genetic evidence has potential to improve future preventive and therapeutic strategies for COPD.	
30801121	The Unsolved Link of Genetic Markers and Crohn's Disease Progression: A North American Cohort Experience.	While progress has been made in the identification of Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility loci, efforts to identify a genetic basis for disease progression have been less fruitful. The specific aim of this study was to build upon the major genetic advances made in IBD by applying genome-wide technologies toward predicting disease progression in CD. Crohn's disease cases (n = 1495) from 3 IBD centers were reviewed by experienced physicians. Clinical and demographic details were collected, focusing on the time to first disease progression. Genome-wide association (GWA) analysis was carried out on 3 clinical outcomes: 1) time to disease progression; 2) time to first abdominal surgery; and 3) a binary analysis of indolent vs progressive disease. Cox-proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used. A GWA analysis was carried out to determine any genetic variation associated with the time to disease progression; 662 cases were included after quality control (QC) and exclusion of any cases with B2/B3 behavior at baseline (n = 450). There were 1360 cases included after QC in the time to abdominal surgery analysis. No variant reached genome-wide significance in any of the 3 analyses performed. Eight known IBD susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were found to be associated with time-to-abdominal surgery SMAD3 (rs17293632), CCR6 (rs1819333), CNTF (rs11229555), TSPAN14 (rs7097656), CARD9 (rs10781499), IPMK (rs2790216), IL10 (rs3024505), and SMURF1 (rs9297145) (P < 0.05). Our GWA study failed to show any SNP-phenotype association reaching genome-wide significance. It is likely that multiple variables affect disease progression, with genetic factors potentially having only a small effect size.	
30823506	Genomic Variations in Susceptibility to Intracranial Aneurysm in the Korean Population.	Genome-wide association studies found genetic variations with modulatory effects for intracranial aneurysm (IA) formations in European and Japanese populations. We aimed to identify the susceptibility of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to IA in a Korean population consisting of 250 patients, and 294 controls using the Asian-specific Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array. Twenty-nine SNPs reached a genome-wide significance threshold (5 × 10(-8)). The rs371331393 SNP, with a stop-gain function of(ARHGAP32) (11q24.3), showed the most significant association with the risk of IA (OR = 43.57, 95% CI: 21.84⁻86.95;(p) = 9.3 × 10(-27)). Eight out of 29 SNPs-(GBA) (rs75822236),(TCF24) (rs112859779),(OLFML2A) (rs79134766),(ARHGAP32) (rs371331393),(CD163L1) (rs138525217),(CUL4A) (rs74115822),(LOC102724084) (rs75861150), and(LRRC3) (rs116969723)-demonstrated sufficient statistical power greater than or equal to 0.8. Two previously reported SNPs, rs700651 ((BOLL), 2q33.1) and rs6841581 ((EDNRA), 4q31.22), were validated in our GWAS (Genome-wide association study). In a subsequent analysis, three SNPs showed a significant difference in expressions: the rs6741819 ((RNF144A), 2p25.1) was down-regulated in the adrenal gland tissue ((p) = 1.5 × 10(-6)), the rs1052270 ((TMOD1). 9q22.33) was up-regulated in the testis tissue ((p) = 8.6 × 10(-10)), and rs6841581 ((EDNRA), 4q31.22) was up-regulated in both the esophagus ((p) = 5.2 × 10(-12)) and skin tissues (1.2 × 10(-6)). Our GWAS showed novel candidate genes with Korean-specific variations in IA formations. Large population based studies are thus warranted.	
30804566	Biological and clinical insights from genetics of insomnia symptoms.	Insomnia is a common disorder linked with adverse long-term medical and psychiatric outcomes. The underlying pathophysiological processes and causal relationships of insomnia with disease are poorly understood. Here we identified 57 loci for self-reported insomnia symptoms in the UK Biobank (n = 453,379) and confirmed their effects on self-reported insomnia symptoms in the HUNT Study (n = 14,923 cases and 47,610 controls), physician-diagnosed insomnia in the Partners Biobank (n = 2,217 cases and 14,240 controls), and accelerometer-derived measures of sleep efficiency and sleep duration in the UK Biobank (n = 83,726). Our results suggest enrichment of genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and of genes expressed in multiple brain regions, skeletal muscle, and adrenal glands. Evidence of shared genetic factors was found between frequent insomnia symptoms and restless legs syndrome, aging, and cardiometabolic, behavioral, psychiatric, and reproductive traits. Evidence was found for a possible causal link between insomnia symptoms and coronary artery disease, depressive symptoms, and subjective well-being.	
30804561	Genetic landscape of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease identifies heterogeneous cell-type and phenotype associations.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality worldwide. Genetic risk loci provide new insights into disease pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study in 35,735 cases and 222,076 controls from the UK Biobank and additional studies from the International COPD Genetics Consortium. We identified 82 loci associated with P < 5 × 10(-8); 47 of these were previously described in association with either COPD or population-based measures of lung function. Of the remaining 35 new loci, 13 were associated with lung function in 79,055 individuals from the SpiroMeta consortium. Using gene expression and regulation data, we identified functional enrichment of COPD risk loci in lung tissue, smooth muscle, and several lung cell types. We found 14 COPD loci shared with either asthma or pulmonary fibrosis. COPD genetic risk loci clustered into groups based on associations with quantitative imaging features and comorbidities. Our analyses provide further support for the genetic susceptibility and heterogeneity of COPD.	
30805717	Shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and Alzheimer's disease: a large-scale genome-wide cross-trait analysis.	A growing number of studies clearly demonstrate a substantial link between metabolic dysfunction and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially glucose-related dysfunction; one hypothesis for this comorbidity is the presence of a common genetic etiology. We conducted a large-scale cross-trait GWAS to investigate the genetic overlap between AD and ten metabolic traits. Among all the metabolic traits, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HDL were found to be genetically associated with AD. Local genetic covariance analysis found that 19q13 region had strong local genetic correlation between AD and T2D (P = 6.78 × 10(- 22)), LDL (P = 1.74 × 10(- 253)) and HDL (P = 7.94 × 10(- 18)). Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 4 loci that were associated with AD and fasting glucose, 3 loci that were associated with AD and fasting insulin, and 20 loci that were associated with AD and HDL (P(meta) < 1.6 × 10(- 8), single trait P < 0.05). Functional analysis revealed that the shared genes are enriched in amyloid metabolic process, lipoprotein remodeling and other related biological pathways; also in pancreas, liver, blood and other tissues. Our work identifies common genetic architectures shared between AD and fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HDL, and sheds light on molecular mechanisms underlying the association between metabolic dysregulation and AD.	
30807572	Genetic association and transcriptome integration identify contributing genes and tissues at cystic fibrosis modifier loci.	Cystic Fibrosis (CF) exhibits morbidity in several organs, including progressive lung disease in all patients and intestinal obstruction at birth (meconium ileus) in ~15%. Individuals with the same causal CFTR mutations show variable disease presentation which is partly attributed to modifier genes. With >6,500 participants from the International CF Gene Modifier Consortium, genome-wide association investigation identified a new modifier locus for meconium ileus encompassing ATP12A on chromosome 13 (min p = 3.83x10(-10)); replicated loci encompassing SLC6A14 on chromosome X and SLC26A9 on chromosome 1, (min p<2.2x10(-16), 2.81x10(-11), respectively); and replicated a suggestive locus on chromosome 7 near PRSS1 (min p = 2.55x10(-7)). PRSS1 is exclusively expressed in the exocrine pancreas and was previously associated with non-CF pancreatitis with functional characterization demonstrating impact on PRSS1 gene expression. We thus asked whether the other meconium ileus modifier loci impact gene expression and in which organ. We developed and applied a colocalization framework called the Simple Sum (SS) that integrates regulatory and genetic association information, and also contrasts colocalization evidence across tissues or genes. The associated modifier loci colocalized with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for ATP12A (p = 3.35x10(-8)), SLC6A14 (p = 1.12x10(-10)) and SLC26A9 (p = 4.48x10(-5)) in the pancreas, even though meconium ileus manifests in the intestine. The meconium ileus susceptibility locus on chromosome X appeared shifted in location from a previously identified locus for CF lung disease severity. Using the SS we integrated the lung disease association locus with eQTLs from nasal epithelia of 63 CF participants and demonstrated evidence of colocalization with airway-specific regulation of SLC6A14 (p = 2.3x10(-4)). Cystic Fibrosis is realizing the promise of personalized medicine, and identification of the contributing organ and understanding of tissue specificity for a gene modifier is essential for the next phase of personalizing therapeutic strategies.	
30808802	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies genetic locus on chromosome 9 associated with Modic changes.	Low back pain (LBP) is a common disabling condition. Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) may be a contributing factor for LBP. Modic change (MC), a distinct phenotype of LDD, is presented as a pathological bone marrow signal change adjacent to vertebral endplate on MRI. It is strongly associated with LBP and has heritability around 30%. Our objective was to identify genetic loci associated with MC using a genome-wide meta-analysis. Presence of MC was evaluated in lumbar MRI in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (n=1182) and TwinsUK (n=647). Genome-wide association analyses were carried out using linear regression model. Inverse-variance weighting approach was used in the meta-analysis. A locus associated with MC (p<5e-8) was found on chromosome 9 with the lead SNP rs1934268 in an intron of the(PTPRD) gene. It is located in the binding region of BCL11A, SPI1 and PBX3 transcription factors. The SNP was nominally associated with LBP in TwinsUK (p=0.001) but not associated in the UK Biobank (p=0.914). Suggestive signals (p<1e-5) were identified near(XKR4),(SCIN),(MGMT),(DLG2),(ZNF184) and(OPRK1).(PTPRD) is a novel candidate gene for MC that may act via the development of cartilage or nervous system; further work is needed to define the mechanisms underlying the pathways leading to development of MC. This is the first genome-wide meta-analysis of MC, and the results pave the way for further studies on the genetic factors underlying the various features of spine degeneration and LBP.	
30808845	Genome-Wide Association Scan of Serum Urea in European Populations Identifies Two Novel Loci.	Serum urea level is a heritable trait, commonly used as a diagnostic marker for kidney function. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in East-Asian populations identified a number of genetic loci related to serum urea, however there is a paucity of data for European populations. We performed a two-stage meta-analysis of GWASs on serum urea in 13,312 participants, with independent replication in 7,379 participants of European ancestry. We identified 6 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near 6 loci, of which 2 were novel (POU2AF1 and ADAMTS9-AS2). Replication of East-Asian and Scottish data provided evidence for an additional 8 loci. SNPs tag regions previously associated with anthropometric traits, serum magnesium, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, as well as expression quantitative trait loci for genes preferentially expressed in kidney and gastro-intestinal tissues. Our findings provide insights into the genetic underpinnings of urea metabolism, with potential relevance to kidney function.	
30809046	Genome-wide association study suggests impact of chromosome 10 rs139401390 on kidney function in patients with coronary artery disease.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for onset and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). Discovery of predisposing loci for kidney function in CAD patients was performed using a genome-wide association approach. Inclusion criteria were CAD with ≥50% stenosis (≥1 coronary artery) and a creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30-75 ml/min/1.73 m(2). An association of rs139401390 located to a region 58.8 kb upstream of renalase (RNLS) with eGFR was detected in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study (n = 499, p = 7.88 × 10(-9), mean eGFR 60.7 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Direct genotyping of rs139401390A > G suggested increased eGFR by 12.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) per A allele (p = 0.000004). Genome-wide replication of rs139401390A > G in the Coronary Artery Disease and Renal Failure (CAD-REF) registry with a mean eGFR of 47.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 574, p = 0.033) was only nominally significant. Comparison of rs139401390 genotypes for risk of reduced kidney function in the overall LURIC study revealed higher adjusted odds ratios (OR) for eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) for CAD patients (n = 1992, OR = 2.36, p = 0.008, G/A + G/G vs A/A) compared to patients with/without CAD (n = 2908, OR = 1.97, p = 0.014, G/A + G/G vs A/A). No significant risk elevation was detected in patients without CAD (n = 948, p = 0.571). rs139401390 may affect kidney function in CAD patients with mild reduction in eGFR.	
30920136	The impact of donor and recipient common clinical and genetic variation on estimated glomerular filtration rate in a European renal transplant population.	Genetic variation across the human leukocyte antigen loci is known to influence renal-transplant outcome. However, the impact of genetic variation beyond the human leukocyte antigen loci is less clear. We tested the association of common genetic variation and clinical characteristics, from both the donor and recipient, with posttransplant eGFR at different time-points, out to 5 years posttransplantation. We conducted GWAS meta-analyses across 10 844 donors and recipients from five European ancestry cohorts. We also analyzed the impact of polygenic risk scores (PRS), calculated using genetic variants associated with nontransplant eGFR, on posttransplant eGFR. PRS calculated using the recipient genotype alone, as well as combined donor and recipient genotypes were significantly associated with eGFR at 1-year posttransplant. Thirty-two percent of the variability in eGFR at 1-year posttransplant was explained by our model containing clinical covariates (including weights for death/graft-failure), principal components and combined donor-recipient PRS, with 0.3% contributed by the PRS. No individual genetic variant was significantly associated with eGFR posttransplant in the GWAS. This is the first study to examine PRS, composed of variants that impact kidney function in the general population, in a posttransplant context. Despite PRS being a significant predictor of eGFR posttransplant, the effect size of common genetic factors is limited compared to clinical variables.	
30820047	Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer's disease identifies new risk loci and implicates Aβ, tau, immunity and lipid processing.	Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 × 10(-7)), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.	
30945673	Genomewide association study for C-reactive protein in Indians replicates known associations of common variants.	Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) serves as an independent biomarker for acute and chronic inflammation, and is also associated with metabolic diseases. Genomewide loci regulating CRP level in Indian population, a high-risk group for metabolic illness, is unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to discover common polymorphisms associated with plasma CRP level in 4493 Indians of Indo-European origin using genomewide association study. Genomewide strong associations of two known intronic variants in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 α gene ((HNF1A)) were identified among Indian subjects. We also detected prior associations of several variants in/near metabolic and inflammatory process genes:(APOC1),(LEPR),(CRP),(HNF4A),(IL6R) and(APOE) with modest associations. This study confirms that Indians from Indo-European origin display similar core universal genetic factors for CRP levels.	
30818990	Interrogating the Genetic Determinants of Tourette's Syndrome and Other Tic Disorders Through Genome-Wide Association Studies.	Tourette's syndrome is polygenic and highly heritable. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches are useful for interrogating the genetic architecture and determinants of Tourette's syndrome and other tic disorders. The authors conducted a GWAS meta-analysis and probed aggregated Tourette's syndrome polygenic risk to test whether Tourette's and related tic disorders have an underlying shared genetic etiology and whether Tourette's polygenic risk scores correlate with worst-ever tic severity and may represent a potential predictor of disease severity. GWAS meta-analysis, gene-based association, and genetic enrichment analyses were conducted in 4,819 Tourette's syndrome case subjects and 9,488 control subjects. Replication of top loci was conducted in an independent population-based sample (706 case subjects, 6,068 control subjects). Relationships between Tourette's polygenic risk scores (PRSs), other tic disorders, ascertainment, and tic severity were examined. GWAS and gene-based analyses identified one genome-wide significant locus within FLT3 on chromosome 13, rs2504235, although this association was not replicated in the population-based sample. Genetic variants spanning evolutionarily conserved regions significantly explained 92.4% of Tourette's syndrome heritability. Tourette's-associated genes were significantly preferentially expressed in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Tourette's PRS significantly predicted both Tourette's syndrome and tic spectrum disorders status in the population-based sample. Tourette's PRS also significantly correlated with worst-ever tic severity and was higher in case subjects with a family history of tics than in simplex case subjects. Modulation of gene expression through noncoding variants, particularly within cortico-striatal circuits, is implicated as a fundamental mechanism in Tourette's syndrome pathogenesis. At a genetic level, tic disorders represent a continuous spectrum of disease, supporting the unification of Tourette's syndrome and other tic disorders in future diagnostic schemata. Tourette's PRSs derived from sufficiently large samples may be useful in the future for predicting conversion of transient tics to chronic tic disorders, as well as tic persistence and lifetime tic severity.	
30824882	Genome-wide association meta-analysis for total thyroid hormone levels in Croatian population.	Thyroid hormones (THs) are key regulators of cellular growth, development, and metabolism. The thyroid gland secretes two THs, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), into the plasma where they are almost all bound reversibly to plasma proteins. Free forms of THs are metabolically active, however, they represent a very small fraction of total TH levels. No genome-wide studies have been performed to date on total TH levels, comprising of protein-bound and free forms of THs. To detect genetic variants associated with total TH levels, we carried out the first GWAS meta-analysis of total T4 levels in 1121 individuals from two Croatian cohorts (Split and Korcula). We also performed GWAS analyses of total T3 levels in 577 individuals and T3/T4 ratio in 571 individuals from the Split cohort. The top association in GWAS meta-analysis of total T4 was detected for an intronic variant within SLC22A9 gene (rs12282281, P = 4.00 × 10(-7)). Within the same region, a genome-wide significant variant (rs11822642, P = 2.50 × 10(-8)) for the T3/T4 ratio was identified. SLC22A9 encodes for an organic anion transporter protein expressed predominantly in the liver and belongs to the superfamily of solute carriers (SLC), a large group of transport membrane proteins. The transport of THs across the plasma membrane in peripheral tissues is facilitated by the membrane proteins, and all TH transport proteins known to date belong to the same SLC superfamily as SLC22A9. These results suggest a potential role for SLC22A9 as a novel transporter protein of THs.	
30818988	Genetic Markers of ADHD-Related Variations in Intracranial Volume.	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex pathophysiology. Intracranial volume (ICV) and volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and putamen are smaller in people with ADHD compared with healthy individuals. The authors investigated the overlap between common genetic variation associated with ADHD risk and these brain volume measures to identify underlying biological processes contributing to the disorder. The authors combined genome-wide association results from the largest available studies of ADHD (N=55,374) and brain volumes (N=11,221-24,704), using a set of complementary methods to investigate overlap at the level of global common variant genetic architecture and at the single variant level. Analyses revealed a significant negative genetic correlation between ADHD and ICV (r(g)=-0.22). Meta-analysis of single variants revealed two significant loci of interest associated with both ADHD risk and ICV; four additional loci were identified for ADHD and volumes of the amygdala, caudate nucleus, and putamen. Exploratory gene-based and gene-set analyses in the ADHD-ICV meta-analytic data showed association with variation in neurite outgrowth-related genes. This is the first genome-wide study to show significant genetic overlap between brain volume measures and ADHD, both on the global and the single variant level. Variants linked to smaller ICV were associated with increased ADHD risk. These findings can help us develop new hypotheses about biological mechanisms by which brain structure alterations may be involved in ADHD disease etiology.	
30833571	A genome-wide association analysis identifies 16 novel susceptibility loci for carpal tunnel syndrome.	Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common and disabling condition of the hand caused by entrapment of the median nerve at the level of the wrist. It is the commonest entrapment neuropathy, with estimates of prevalence ranging between 5-10%. Here, we undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of an entrapment neuropathy, using 12,312 CTS cases and 389,344 controls identified in UK Biobank. We discover 16 susceptibility loci for CTS with p < 5 × 10(-8). We identify likely causal genes in the pathogenesis of CTS, including ADAMTS17, ADAMTS10 and EFEMP1, and using RNA sequencing demonstrate expression of these genes in surgically resected tenosynovium from CTS patients. We perform Mendelian randomisation and demonstrate a causal relationship between short stature and higher risk of CTS. We suggest that variants within genes implicated in growth and extracellular matrix architecture contribute to the genetic predisposition to CTS by altering the environment through which the median nerve transits.	
30837465	Assessing the causal association of glycine with risk of cardio-metabolic diseases.	Circulating levels of glycine have previously been associated with lower incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) but it remains uncertain if glycine plays an aetiological role. We present a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for glycine in 80,003 participants and investigate the causality and potential mechanisms of the association between glycine and cardio-metabolic diseases using genetic approaches. We identify 27 genetic loci, of which 22 have not previously been reported for glycine. We show that glycine is genetically associated with lower CHD risk and find that this may be partly driven by blood pressure. Evidence for a genetic association of glycine with T2D is weaker, but we find a strong inverse genetic effect of hyperinsulinaemia on glycine. Our findings strengthen evidence for a protective effect of glycine on CHD and show that the glycine-T2D association may be driven by a glycine-lowering effect of insulin resistance.	
30837455	Genome wide analysis for mouth ulcers identifies associations at immune regulatory loci.	Mouth ulcers are the most common ulcerative condition and encompass several clinical diagnoses, including recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Despite previous evidence for heritability, it is not clear which specific genetic loci are implicated in RAS. In this genome-wide association study (n = 461,106) heritability is estimated at 8.2% (95% CI: 6.4%, 9.9%). This study finds 97 variants which alter the odds of developing non-specific mouth ulcers and replicate these in an independent cohort (n = 355,744) (lead variant after meta-analysis: rs76830965, near IL12A, OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.73); P = 4.4e-483). Additional effect estimates from three independent cohorts with more specific phenotyping and specific study characteristics support many of these findings. In silico functional analyses provide evidence for a role of T cell regulation in the aetiology of mouth ulcers. These results provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of a common, important condition.	
30846698	Genome-wide association study identifies genetic loci for self-reported habitual sleep duration supported by accelerometer-derived estimates.	Sleep is an essential state of decreased activity and alertness but molecular factors regulating sleep duration remain unknown. Through genome-wide association analysis in 446,118 adults of European ancestry from the UK Biobank, we identify 78 loci for self-reported habitual sleep duration (p < 5 × 10(-8); 43 loci at p < 6 × 10(-9)). Replication is observed for PAX8, VRK2, and FBXL12/UBL5/PIN1 loci in the CHARGE study (n = 47,180; p < 6.3 × 10(-4)), and 55 signals show sign-concordant effects. The 78 loci further associate with accelerometer-derived sleep duration, daytime inactivity, sleep efficiency and number of sleep bouts in secondary analysis (n = 85,499). Loci are enriched for pathways including striatum and subpallium development, mechanosensory response, dopamine binding, synaptic neurotransmission and plasticity, among others. Genetic correlation indicates shared links with anthropometric, cognitive, metabolic, and psychiatric traits and two-sample Mendelian randomization highlights a bidirectional causal link with schizophrenia. This work provides insights into the genetic basis for inter-individual variation in sleep duration implicating multiple biological pathways.	
30843173	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel loci associated with free triiodothyronine and thyroid-stimulating hormone.	Thyroid hormones are essential for the normal function of almost all human tissues, and have critical roles in metabolism, differentiation and growth. Free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are under strong genetic influence; however, most of the heritability is yet unexplained. In order to identify novel loci associated with fT3, fT4 and TSH serum levels we performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of 7 411 206 polymorphisms in up to 1731 euthyroid individuals from three Croatian cohorts from Dalmatia region: two genetically isolated island populations and one mainland population. Additionally, we also performed a bivariate analysis of fT3 and fT4 levels. The EPHB2 gene variant rs67142165 reached genome-wide significance for association with fT3 plasma levels (P = 9.27 × 10(-9)) and its significance was confirmed in bivariate analysis (P = 9.72 × 10(-9)). We also found a genome-wide significant association for variant rs13037502 upstream of the PTPN1 gene and TSH plasma levels (P = 1.67 × 10(-8)). We identified a first genome-wide significant variant associated with fT3 plasma levels, as well as a novel locus associated with TSH plasma levels. These findings are biologically relevant and enrich our knowledge about the genetic basis of pituitary-thyroid axis function.	
30866520	Circulating Chemerin Levels, but not the 	Chemerin, a novel adipokine, has been associated with metabolic, inflammatory, and atherosclerotic diseases. We aimed to determine the genetic basis of chemerin levels by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to investigate the role of(RARRES2) polymorphisms and circulating chemerin levels in the long-term outcome of coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 2197 participants from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) were recruited for the GWAS analysis, and 481 patients with angiographically confirmed CAD were enrolled for long-term outcome analysis. One locus of genome-wide significance with a single independent association signal was identified in the GWAS for chemerin levels with the peak association at the(RARRES2) gene promoter region polymorphism rs3735167 ((p) = 2.35 × 10(-21)). In the CAD population, borderline significance was noted between(RARRES2) polymorphisms and chemerin levels, whereas high chemerin levels were associated with obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, current smoking, high platelet and leukocyte counts, anemia, impaired renal function, high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and multi-vessel disease. Kaplan⁻Meier survival curves indicated that the patients with high chemerin and CRP levels, but not those with(RARRES2) polymorphisms, had a lower survival rate and higher combined cerebral and cardiovascular event rates. Combined chemerin and CRP levels further revealed a stepwise increase in poor clinical outcomes from low- to high-risk subgroups. In conclusion, rs3735167 is the lead(RARRES2) polymorphism for chemerin levels in Taiwanese. Chemerin levels, but not the rs3735167 genotypes, predicted the long-term outcome of CAD, especially when combined with CRP levels.	
30850646	Genome-wide association study in frontal fibrosing alopecia identifies four susceptibility loci including HLA-B*07:02.	Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a recently described inflammatory and scarring type of hair loss affecting almost exclusively women. Despite a dramatic recent increase in incidence the aetiopathogenesis of FFA remains unknown. We undertake genome-wide association studies in females from a UK cohort, comprising 844 cases and 3,760 controls, a Spanish cohort of 172 cases and 385 controls, and perform statistical meta-analysis. We observe genome-wide significant association with FFA at four genomic loci: 2p22.2, 6p21.1, 8q24.22 and 15q2.1. Within the 6p21.1 locus, fine-mapping indicates that the association is driven by the HLA-B*07:02 allele. At 2p22.1, we implicate a putative causal missense variant in CYP1B1, encoding the homonymous xenobiotic- and hormone-processing enzyme. Transcriptomic analysis of affected scalp tissue highlights overrepresentation of transcripts encoding components of innate and adaptive immune response pathways. These findings provide insight into disease pathogenesis and characterise FFA as a genetically predisposed immuno-inflammatory disorder driven by HLA-B*07:02.	
30852652	The metabolic network coherence of human transcriptomes is associated with genetic variation at the cadherin 18 locus.	Metabolic coherence (MC) is a network-based approach to dimensionality reduction that can be used, for example, to interpret the joint expression of genes linked to human metabolism. Computationally, the derivation of 'transcriptomic' MC involves mapping of an individual gene expression profile onto a gene-centric network derived beforehand from a metabolic network (currently Recon2), followed by the determination of the connectivity of a particular, profile-specific subnetwork. The biological significance of MC has been exemplified previously in the context of human inflammatory bowel disease, among others, but the genetic architecture of this quantitative cellular trait is still unclear. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MC in the 1000 Genomes/ GEUVADIS data (n = 457) and identified a solitary genome-wide significant association with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the intronic region of the cadherin 18 (CDH18) gene on chromosome 5 (lead SNP: rs11744487, p = 1.2 × 10(- 8)). Cadherin 18 is a transmembrane protein involved in human neural development and cell-to-cell signaling. Notably, genetic variation at the CDH18 locus has been associated with metabolic syndrome-related traits before. Replication of our genome-wide significant GWAS result was successful in another population study from the Netherlands (BIOS, n = 2661; lead SNP), but failed in two additional studies (KORA, Germany, n = 711; GENOA, USA, n = 411). Besides sample size issues, we surmise that these discrepant findings may be attributable to technical differences. While 1000 Genomes/GEUVADIS and BIOS gene expression profiles were generated by RNA sequencing, the KORA and GENOA data were microarray-based. In addition to providing first evidence for a link between regional genetic variation and a metabolism-related characteristic of human transcriptomes, our findings highlight the benefit of adopting a systems biology-oriented approach to molecular data analysis.	
30854688	Genome-wide Association Studies of Specific Antinuclear Autoantibody Subphenotypes in Primary Biliary Cholangitis.	Anti-nuclear antibodies to speckled 100 kDa (sp100) and glycoprotein 210 (gp210) are specific serologic markers of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) of uncertain/controversial clinical or prognostic significance. To study the genetic determinants associated with sp100 and gp210 autoantibody subphenotypes, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of 930 PBC cases based on their autoantibody status, followed by a replication study in 1,252 PBC cases. We confirmed single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs492899 (P = 3.27 × 10(-22) ; odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.34-3.66) and rs1794280 (P = 5.78 × 10(-28) ; OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 3.05-4.96) in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region associated with the sp100 autoantibody. However, no genetic variant was identified as being associated with the gp210 autoantibody. To further define specific classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles or amino acids associated with the sp100 autoantibody, we imputed 922 PBC cases (211 anti-sp100-positive versus 711 negative cases) using a Han Chinese MHC reference database. Conditional analysis identified that HLA-DRβ1-Asn77/Arg74, DRβ1-Ser37, and DPβ1-Lys65 were major determinants for sp100 production. For the classical HLA alleles, the strongest association was with DRB1*03:01 (P = 1.51 × 10(-9) ; OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.06-4.29). Regression analysis with classical HLA alleles identified DRB1*03:01, DRB1*15:01, DRB1*01, and DPB1*03:01 alleles can explain most of the HLA association with sp100 autoantibody. Conclusion: This study indicated significant genetic predisposition to the sp100 autoantibody, but not the gp210 autoantibody, subphenotype in PBC patients. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if these findings have clinical significance to PBC pathogenesis and/or therapeutics.	
30910378	Identification of 22 novel loci associated with urinary biomarkers of albumin, sodium, and potassium excretion.	Urine biomarkers reflecting kidney function and handling of dietary sodium and potassium are strongly associated with several common diseases including chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Knowledge about the genetic determinants of these biomarkers may shed light on pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of these diseases. We performed genome-wide association studies of urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR), urinary potassium: creatinine ratio (UK/UCr), urinary sodium: creatinine ratio (UNa/UCr) and urinary sodium: potassium ratio (UNa/UK) in up to 218,450 (discovery) and 109,166 (replication) unrelated individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Further, we explored genetic correlations, tissue-specific gene expression, and possible genes implicated in the regulation of these biomarkers. After replication, we identified 19 genome-wide significant independent loci associated with UACR, 6 each with UK/UCr and UNa/UCr, and 4 with UNa/UK. In addition to 22 novel associations, we confirmed several established associations, including between the CUBN locus and microalbuminuria. We detected high pairwise genetic correlation across the urinary biomarkers, and between their levels and several physiological measurements. We highlight GIPR, a potential diabetes drug target, as possibly implicated in the genetic control of urinary potassium excretion, and NRBP1, a locus associated with gout, as plausibly involved in sodium and albumin excretion. Overall, we identified 22 novel genome-wide significant associations with urinary biomarkers and confirmed several previously established associations, providing new insights into the genetic basis of these traits and their connection to chronic diseases.	
30867560	Genetic contributions to two special factors of neuroticism are associated with affluence, higher intelligence, better health, and longer life.	Higher scores on the personality trait of neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions, are associated with worse mental and physical health. Studies examining links between neuroticism and health typically operationalize neuroticism by summing the items from a neuroticism scale. However, neuroticism is made up of multiple heterogeneous facets, each contributing to the effect of neuroticism as a whole. A recent study showed that a 12-item neuroticism scale described one broad trait of general neuroticism and two special factors, one characterizing the extent to which people worry and feel vulnerable, and the other characterizing the extent to which people are anxious and tense. This study also found that, although individuals who were higher on general neuroticism lived shorter lives, individuals whose neuroticism was characterized by worry and vulnerability lived longer lives. Here, we examine the genetic contributions to the two special factors of neuroticism-anxiety/tension and worry/vulnerability-and how they contrast with that of general neuroticism. First, we show that, whereas the polygenic load for neuroticism is associated with the genetic risk of coronary artery disease, lower intelligence, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and poorer self-rated health, the genetic variants associated with high levels of anxiety/tension, and high levels of worry/vulnerability are associated with genetic variants linked to higher SES, higher intelligence, better self-rated health, and longer life. Second, we identify genetic variants that are uniquely associated with these protective aspects of neuroticism. Finally, we show that different neurological pathways are linked to each of these neuroticism phenotypes.	
30886212	Genome-wide association analysis reveals KCTD12 and miR-383-binding genes in the background of rumination.	Ruminative response style is a passive and repetitive way of responding to stress, associated with several disorders. Although twin and candidate gene studies have proven the genetic underpinnings of rumination, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been conducted yet. We performed a GWAS on ruminative response style and its two subtypes, brooding and reflection, among 1758 European adults recruited in the general population of Budapest, Hungary, and Manchester, United Kingdom. We evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based, gene-based and gene set-based tests, together with inferences on genes regulated by our most significant SNPs. While no genome-wide significant hit emerged at the SNP level, the association of rumination survived correction for multiple testing with KCTD12 at the gene level, and with the set of genes binding miR-383 at the gene set level. SNP-level results were concordant between the Budapest and Manchester subsamples for all three rumination phenotypes. SNP-level results and their links to brain expression levels based on external databases supported the role of KCTD12, SRGAP3, and SETD5 in rumination, CDH12 in brooding, and DPYSL5, MAPRE3, KCNK3, ATXN7L3B, and TPH2 in reflection, among others. The relatively low sample size is a limitation of our study. Results of the first GWAS on rumination identified genes previously implicated in psychiatric disorders underscoring the transdiagnostic nature of rumination, and pointed to the possible role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in this cognitive process.	
30889042	An initial genetic analysis of gemcitabine-induced high-grade neutropenia in pancreatic cancer patients in CALGB 80303 (Alliance).	One of the standard of care regimens for advanced pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. The efficacy of gemcitabine is limited by dose-limiting hematologic toxicities especially neutropenia. Uncovering the variability of these toxicities attributed to germline DNA variation is of great importance. CALGB 80303 was a randomized study in advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine with or without bevacizumab. The study protocol included genotyping of genes of gemcitabine disposition (CDA, DCTD, SLC29A1, SLC28A1, and SLC29A2), as well as a genome-wide analysis. The clinical phenotype was time to early high-grade neutropenia event accounting for progression or death or other treatment-terminating adverse events as competing for informative events. The inference was carried out on the basis of the association between genotype and cause-specific hazard of a neutropenic event. The primary analyses were carried out on the basis of 294 genetically estimated European pancreatic cancer patients. For CDA rs2072671 (A>C), AC and CC patients had a lower risk of neutropenia than AA patients (P=0.01, hazard ratio: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.89). For SLC28A1 rs3825876 (G>A), AA patients have a higher risk of neutropenia than GA and GG patients (P=0.02, hazard ratio: 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.16). CDA rs2072671 was associated with increased mRNA expression in whole blood in three studies (P=2.7e-14, 6.61e-62, and 9.70e-65). In the genome-wide analysis, variants in TGFB2 were among the top hits (lowest P=1.62e-06) but had no effect in luciferase assays. This is the first genetic analysis of gemcitabine-induced neutropenia using a competing risk model in a prospective randomized clinical study has proposed a potentially novel mechanism of the protective effect of the CDA rs2072671 variant. Further confirmation is needed.	
30888730	Meta-Analysis of Genomewide Association Studies Reveals Genetic Variants for Hip Bone Geometry.	Hip geometry is an important predictor of fracture. We performed a meta-analysis of GWAS studies in adults to identify genetic variants that are associated with proximal femur geometry phenotypes. We analyzed four phenotypes: (i) femoral neck length; (ii) neck-shaft angle; (iii) femoral neck width, and (iv) femoral neck section modulus, estimated from DXA scans using algorithms of hip structure analysis. In the Discovery stage, 10 cohort studies were included in the fixed-effect meta-analysis, with up to 18,719 men and women ages 16 to 93 years. Association analyses were performed with ∼2.5 million polymorphisms under an additive model adjusted for age, body mass index, and height. Replication analyses of meta-GWAS significant loci (at adjusted genomewide significance [GWS], threshold p ≤ 2.6 × 10(-8) ) were performed in seven additional cohorts in silico. We looked up SNPs associated in our analysis, for association with height, bone mineral density (BMD), and fracture. In meta-analysis (combined Discovery and Replication stages), GWS associations were found at 5p15 (IRX1 and ADAMTS16); 5q35 near FGFR4; at 12p11 (in CCDC91); 11q13 (near LRP5 and PPP6R3 (rs7102273)). Several hip geometry signals overlapped with BMD, including LRP5 (chr. 11). Chr. 11 SNP rs7102273 was associated with any-type fracture (p = 7.5 × 10(-5) ). We used bone transcriptome data and discovered several significant eQTLs, including rs7102273 and PPP6R3 expression (p = 0.0007), and rs6556301 (intergenic, chr.5 near FGFR4) and PDLIM7 expression (p = 0.005). In conclusion, we found associations between several genes and hip geometry measures that explained 12% to 22% of heritability at different sites. The results provide a defined set of genes related to biological pathways relevant to BMD and etiology of bone fragility. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.	
30898391	Genome-wide association studies identify susceptibility loci for epithelial ovarian cancer in east Asian women.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have focused largely on populations of European ancestry. We aimed to identify common germline variants associated with EOC risk in Asian women. Genotyping was performed as part of the OncoArray project. Samples with >60% Asian ancestry were included in the analysis. Genotyping was performed on 533,631 SNPs in 3238 Asian subjects diagnosed with invasive or borderline EOC and 4083 unaffected controls. After imputation, genotypes were available for 11,595,112 SNPs to identify associations. At chromosome 6p25.2, SNP rs7748275 was associated with risk of serous EOC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, P = 8.7 × 10(-9)) and high-grade serous EOC (HGSOC) (OR = 1.34, P = 4.3 × 10(-9)). SNP rs6902488 at 6p25.2 (r(2) = 0.97 with rs7748275) lies in an active enhancer and is predicted to impact binding of STAT3, P300 and ELF1. We identified additional risk loci with low Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP) scores, indicating they are likely to be true risk associations (BFDP <10%). At chromosome 20q11.22, rs74272064 was associated with HGSOC risk (OR = 1.27, P = 9.0 × 10(-8)). Overall EOC risk was associated with rs10260419 at chromosome 7p21.3 (OR = 1.33, P = 1.2 × 10(-7)) and rs74917072 at chromosome 2q37.3 (OR = 1.25, P = 4.7 × 10(-7)). At 2q37.3, expression quantitative trait locus analysis in 404 HGSOC tissues identified ESPNL as a putative candidate susceptibility gene (P = 1.2 × 10(-7)). While some risk loci were shared between East Asian and European populations, others were population-specific, indicating that the landscape of EOC risk in Asian women has both shared and unique features compared to women of European ancestry.	
30899065	A genome-wide association study on photic sneeze reflex in the Chinese population.	Photic sneeze reflex (PSR) is an interesting but yet mysterious phenotype featured by individuals' response of sneezing in exposure to bright light. To uncover the underlying genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs), a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted exclusively in a Chinese population of 3417 individuals (PSR prevalence at 25.6%), and reproducibly identified both a replicative rs10427255 on 2q22.3 and a novel locus of rs1032507 on 3p12.1 in various effect models (additive, as well as dominant and recessive). Minor alleles respectively contributed to increased or reduced risk for PSR with odds ratio (95% confidence interval) at 1.68 ([1.50, 1.88]) for rs10427255 and 0.65 ([0.58, 0.72]) for rs1032507. The two independent SNPs were intergenic, and collectively enhanced PSR classification by lifting the area-under-curve value in ROC curve to 0.657. Together with previous GWAS in other populations, the result substantiated the polygenic and non-ethnicity-specific nature behind the PSR phenotype.	
30895295	A Genome-Wide Association Study of Skin and Iris Pigmentation among Individuals of South Asian Ancestry.	South Asia has a complex history of migrations and is characterized by substantial pigmentary and genetic diversity. For this reason, it is an ideal region to study the genetic architecture of normal pigmentation variation. Here, we present a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of skin pigmentation using skin reflectance (M-index) as a quantitative phenotype. The meta-analysis includes a sample of individuals of South Asian descent living in Canada (N = 348), and a sample of individuals from two caste and four tribal groups from West Maharashtra, India (N = 480). We also present the first GWAS of iris color in South Asian populations. This GWAS was based on quantitative measures of iris color obtained from high-resolution iris pictures. We identified genome-wide significant associations of variants within the well-known gene SLC24A5, including the nonsynonymous rs1426654 polymorphism, with both skin pigmentation and iris color, highlighting the pleiotropic effects of this gene on pigmentation. Variants in the HERC2 gene (e.g., rs12913832) were also associated with iris color and iris heterochromia. Our study emphasizes the usefulness of quantitative methods to study iris color variation. We also identified novel genome-wide significant associations with skin pigmentation and iris color, but we could not replicate these associations due to the lack of independent samples. It will be critical to expand the number of studies in South Asian populations in order to better understand the genetic variation driving the diversity of skin pigmentation and iris color observed in this region.	
30911093	Genome-wide association study of blood lipids in Indians confirms universality of established variants.	Lipids foster energy production and their altered levels have been coupled with metabolic ailments. Indians feature high prevalence of metabolic diseases, yet uncharacterized for genes regulating lipid homeostasis. We performed first GWAS for quantitative lipids (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) exclusively in 5271 Indians. Further to corroborate our genetic findings, we investigated DNA methylation marks in peripheral blood in Indians at the identified loci (N = 233) and retrieved gene regulatory features from public domains. Recurrent GWAS loci-CELSR2, CETP, LPL, ZNF259, and BUD13 cropped up as lead signals in Indians, reflecting their universal applicability. Besides established variants, we found certain unreported variants at sub-genome-wide level-QKI, REEP3, TMCC2, FAM129C, FAM241B, and LOC100506207. These variants though failed to attain GWAS significance in Indians, but largely turned out to be active CpG sites in human subcutaneous adipose tissue and showed robust association to two or more lipid traits. Of which, QKI variants showed significant association to all four lipid traits and their designated region was observed to be a key gene regulatory segment denoting active transcription particularly in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Both established and novel loci were observed to be significantly associated with altered DNA methylation in Indians for specific CpGs that resided in key regulatory elements. Further, gene-based association analysis pinpointed novel GWAS loci-LINC01340 and IQCJ-SCHIP1 for TC; IFT27, IFT88, and LINC02141 for HDL; and TEX26 for TG. Present study ascertains universality of selected known genes and also identifies certain novel loci for lipids in Indians by integrating data from various levels of gene regulation.	
30929738	Genetic Architectures of Childhood- and Adult-Onset Asthma Are Partly Distinct.	The extent to which genetic risk factors are shared between childhood-onset (COA) and adult-onset (AOA) asthma has not been estimated. On the basis of data from the UK Biobank study (n = 447,628), we found that the variance in disease liability explained by common variants is higher for COA (onset at ages between 0 and 19 years; h(2)(g) = 25.6%) than for AOA (onset at ages between 20 and 60 years; h(2)(g) = 10.6%). The genetic correlation (r(g)) between COA and AOA was 0.67. Variation in age of onset among COA-affected individuals had a low heritability (h(2)(g) = 5%), which we confirmed in independent studies and also among AOA-affected individuals. To identify subtype-specific genetic associations, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the UK Biobank for COA (13,962 affected individuals) and a separate GWAS for AOA (26,582 affected individuals) by using a common set of 300,671 controls for both studies. We identified 123 independent associations for COA and 56 for AOA (37 overlapped); of these, 98 and 34, respectively, were reproducible in an independent study (n = 262,767). Collectively, 28 associations were not previously reported. For 96 COA-associated variants, including five variants that represent COA-specific risk factors, the risk allele was more common in COA- than in AOA-affected individuals. Conversely, we identified three variants that are stronger risk factors for AOA. Variants associated with obesity and smoking had a stronger contribution to the risk of AOA than to the risk of COA. Lastly, we identified 109 likely target genes of the associated variants, primarily on the basis of correlated expression quantitative trait loci (up to n = 31,684). GWAS informed by age of onset can identify subtype-specific risk variants, which can help us understand differences in pathophysiology between COA and AOA and so can be informative for drug development.	
30926877	Genome-wide association analysis suggests novel loci underlying thyroid antibodies in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.	Thyroid antibodies against thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are key markers of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), the most common autoimmune thyroid disorder. Genetic determinants of thyroid antibodies are still poorly known, especially as they were not studied in patients with thyroid diseases. We performed the first genome-wide association analysis of thyroid antibodies in 430 HT patients that may be considered as population extremes for thyroid antibodies distribution. We detected two suggestively associated genetic variants with TgAb, rs6972286 close to ANKRD7 and LSM8 (P = 2.34 × 10(-7)) and rs756763 inside CA10 (P = 6.05 × 10(-7)), and one with TPOAb, rs12507813 positioned between TRIM61 and TRIM60 (P = 4.95 × 10(-7)). Bivariate analysis resulted with three suggestively associated genetic variants that predispose to both antibodies: rs13190616 inside RP11-138J23.1 (P = 2.01 × 10(-6)), rs561030786 close to DUBR (P = 7.33 × 10(-6)) and rs12713034 inside FSHR (P = 7.66 × 10(-6)). All identified genomic regions have a substantial literature record of involvement with female-related traits, immune-mediated diseases and personality traits that are all characterized by increased thyroid antibody levels. Our findings demonstrate the existence of genetic overlap between thyroid autoimmunity in HT and different non-thyroid diseases characterized by the presence of thyroid antibodies. We also suggest that genetic variants that regulate antibody levels may differ between HT patients and individuals with normal thyroid function.	
30922102	Pharmacogenomic Variants and Drug Interactions Identified Through the Genetic Analysis of Clozapine Metabolism.	Clozapine is the only effective medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but its worldwide use is still limited because of its complex titration protocols. While the discovery of pharmacogenomic variants of clozapine metabolism may improve clinical management, no robust findings have yet been reported. This study is the first to adopt the framework of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to discover genetic markers of clozapine plasma concentrations in a large sample of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The authors used mixed-model regression to combine data from multiple assays of clozapine metabolite plasma concentrations from a clozapine monitoring service and carried out a genome-wide analysis of clozapine, norclozapine, and their ratio on 10,353 assays from 2,989 individuals. These analyses were adjusted for demographic factors known to influence clozapine metabolism, although it was not possible to adjust for all potential mediators given the available data. GWAS results were used to pinpoint specific enzymes and metabolic pathways and compounds that might interact with clozapine pharmacokinetics. The authors identified four distinct genome-wide significant loci that harbor common variants affecting the metabolism of clozapine or its metabolites. Detailed examination pointed to coding and regulatory variants at several CYP* and UGT* genes as well as corroborative evidence for interactions between the metabolism of clozapine, coffee, and tobacco. Individual effects of single single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fine-mapped from these loci were large, such as the minor allele of rs2472297, which was associated with a reduction in clozapine concentrations roughly equivalent to a decrease of 50 mg/day in clozapine dosage. On their own, these single SNPs explained from 1.15% to 9.48% of the variance in the plasma concentration data. Common genetic variants with large effects on clozapine metabolism exist and can be found via genome-wide approaches. Their identification opens the way for clinical studies assessing the use of pharmacogenomics in the clinical management of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.	
30940143	Genetic overlap of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease-related traits: a large-scale genome-wide cross-trait analysis.	A growing number of studies clearly demonstrate a substantial association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), although little is known about the shared genetics that contribute to this association. We conducted a large-scale cross-trait genome-wide association study to investigate genetic overlap between COPD (N(case) = 12,550, N(control) = 46,368) from the International COPD Genetics Consortium and four primary cardiac traits: resting heart rate (RHR) (N = 458,969), high blood pressure (HBP) (N(case) = 144,793, N(control) = 313,761), coronary artery disease (CAD)(N(case) = 60,801, N(control) = 123,504), and stroke (N(case) = 40,585, N(control) = 406,111) from UK Biobank, CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium, and International Stroke Genetics Consortium data. RHR and HBP had modest genetic correlation, and CAD had borderline evidence with COPD at a genome-wide level. We found evidence of local genetic correlation with particular regions of the genome. Cross-trait meta-analysis of COPD identified 21 loci jointly associated with RHR, 22 loci with HBP, and 3 loci with CAD. Functional analysis revealed that shared genes were enriched in smoking-related pathways and in cardiovascular, nervous, and immune system tissues. An examination of smoking-related genetic variants identified SNPs located in 15q25.1 region associated with cigarettes per day, with effects on RHR and CAD. A Mendelian randomization analysis showed a significant positive causal effect of COPD on RHR (causal estimate = 0.1374, P = 0.008). In a set of large-scale GWAS, we identify evidence of shared genetics between COPD and cardiac traits.	
30941828	Common genetic variants have associations with human cortical brain regions and risk of schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia is a highly heritable mental disorder and is reported to be associated with measurements in cortical regions of the human brain. In this study, we considered genome-wide association studies to uncover genetic effects on cortical regions and prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. Specifically, area, thickness, and volume of 66 cortical regions derived from magnetic resonance imaging scans of 1,445 children and adolescents from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort were studied. Two common variants were identified as being associated with two prefrontal cortical regions (one significant variant rs11601331 on chromosome 11p11 for right rostral middle frontal gyral area, p = 1.97 × 10(-8) ; one suggestive variant rs2345981 on chromosome 6q11 for left frontal pole gyral volume, p = 2.07 × 10(-7) ), where the significance of rs11601331 was independently replicated on the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics study of size 1,239 (p = 9.19 × 10(-3) ). Moreover, genetic effects on schizophrenia were investigated based on a sample of 8,719 subjects. The two identified variants rs11601331 and rs2345981 showed significant association with the longest prodromal symptoms duration (p = 0.048 and p = 0.027, respectively).	
30944420	Identification of a 1p21 independent functional variant for abdominal obesity.	Aiming to uncover the genetic basis of abdominal obesity, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of trunk fat mass adjusted by trunk lean mass (TFM(adj)) and followed by a series of functional investigations. A total of 11,569 subjects from six samples were included into the GWAS meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed by a weighted fixed-effects model. In silico replication analysis was performed in the UK-Biobank (UKB) sample (N = 331,093) and in the GIANT study (N up to 110,204). Cis-expression QTL (cis-eQTL) analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay and electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) were conducted to examine the functional relevance of the identified SNPs. At last, differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed. We identified an independent SNP rs12409479 at 1p21 (MAF = 0.07, p = 7.26 × 10(-10)), whose association was replicated by the analysis of TFM in the UKB sample (one-sided p = 3.39 × 10(-3)), and was cross-validated by the analyses of BMI (one-sided p = 0.03) and WHR(adj) (one-sided p = 0.04) in the GIANT study. Cis-eQTL analysis demonstrated that allele A at rs12409479 was positively associated with PTBP2 expression level in subcutaneous adipose tissue (N = 385, p = 4.15 × 10(-3)). Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that the region repressed PTBP2 gene expression by downregulating PTBP2 promoter activity (p < 0.001), and allele A at rs12409479 induced higher luciferase activity than allele G did (p = 4.15 × 10(-3)). EMSA experiment implied that allele A was more capable of binding to unknown transcription factors than allele G. Lastly, DGEA showed that the level of PTBP2 expression was higher in individuals with obesity than in individuals without obesity (N = 20 and 11, p = 0.04 and 9.22 × 10(-3)), suggesting a regulatory role in obesity development. Taken together, we hypothesize a regulating path from rs12409479 to trunk fat mass development through its allelic specific regulation of PTBP2 gene expression, thus providing some novel insight into the genetic basis of abdominal obesity.	
30946743	Genome-wide association study in Turkish and Iranian populations identify rare familial Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) polymorphisms associated with ankylosing spondylitis.	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a highly heritable immune-mediated arthritis common in Turkish and Iranian populations. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease most common in people of Mediterranean origin. MEFV, an FMF-associated gene, is also a candidate gene for AS. We aimed to identify AS susceptibility loci and also examine the association between MEFV and AS in Turkish and Iranian cohorts. We performed genome-wide association studies in 1001 Turkish AS patients and 1011 Turkish controls, and 479 Iranian AS patients and 830 Iranian controls. Serum IL-1β, IL-17 and IL-23 cytokine levels were quantified in Turkish samples. An association of major effect was observed with a novel rare coding variant in MEFV in the Turkish cohort (rs61752717, M694V, OR = 5.3, P = 7.63×10(-12)), Iranian cohort (OR = 2.9, P = 0.042), and combined dataset (OR = 5.1, P = 1.65×10(-13)). 99.6% of Turkish AS cases, and 96% of those carrying MEFV rs61752717 variants, did not have FMF. In Turkish subjects, the association of rs61752717 was particularly strong in HLA-B27-negative cases (OR = 7.8, P = 8.93×10(-15)), but also positive in HLA-B27-positive cases (OR = 4.3, P = 7.69×10(-8)). Serum IL-1β, IL-17 and IL-23 levels were higher in AS cases than controls. Among AS cases, serum IL-1β and IL-23 levels were increased in MEFV 694V carriers compared with non-carriers. Our data suggest that FMF and AS have overlapping aetiopathogenic mechanisms. Functionally important MEFV mutations, such as M694V, lead to dysregulated inflammasome function and excessive IL-1β function. As IL-1 inhibition is effective in FMF, AS cases carrying FMF-associated MEFV variants may benefit from such therapy.	
30945699	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Genetic Prediction Model for Postoperative Survival in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	BACKGROUND As an important aspect of tumor heterogeneity, genetic variation may influence susceptibility and prognosis in different types of cancer. By exploring the prognostic value of genetic variation, this study aimed to establish a model for predicting postoperative survival and assessing the impact of variation on clinical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIAL AND METHODS A genome-wide association study of 367 patients with HCC was conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with prognosis. Identified predictors were further evaluated in 758 patients. Two prognostic models were established using Cox proportional hazards regression and Nomogram strategy, and validated in another 316 patients. The effect of the SNP rs2431 was analyzed in detail. RESULTS A prognostic model including 5 SNPs (rs10893585, rs2431, rs34675408, rs6078460, and rs6766361) was established and exhibited high predictive accuracy for HCC prognosis. The panel combined with tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage resulted in a significantly higher c-index (0.723) than the individual c-index values. Stratified by the Nomogram prediction model, the median overall survival for the low-risk and high-risk groups were 100.1 versus 30.8 months (P<0.001) in the training set and 82.2 versus 22.5 months (P<0.001) in the validation set. A closer examination of rs2431 revealed that it may regulate the expression of FNDC3B by disrupting a microRNA-binding site. CONCLUSIONS This study established prediction models based on genetic factors alone or in combination with TNM stage for postoperative survival in patients with HCC, and identified FNDC3B as a potential therapeutic target for combating HCC metastasis.	
30946739	Genome-wide association study reveals sex-specific genetic architecture of facial attractiveness.	Facial attractiveness is a complex human trait of great interest in both academia and industry. Literature on sociological and phenotypic factors associated with facial attractiveness is rich, but its genetic basis is poorly understood. In this paper, we conducted a genome-wide association study to discover genetic variants associated with facial attractiveness using 4,383 samples in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. We identified two genome-wide significant loci, highlighted a handful of candidate genes, and demonstrated enrichment for heritability in human tissues involved in reproduction and hormone synthesis. Additionally, facial attractiveness showed strong and negative genetic correlations with BMI in females and with blood lipids in males. Our analysis also suggested sex-specific selection pressure on variants associated with lower male attractiveness. These results revealed sex-specific genetic architecture of facial attractiveness and provided fundamental new insights into its genetic basis.	
31006500	Protein and fat intake interacts with the haplotype of PTPN11_rs11066325, RPH3A_rs886477, and OAS3_rs2072134 to modulate serum HDL concentrations in middle-aged people.	Low serum HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and it is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We hypothesized that genetic variants that decrease serum HDL-C concentrations may interact with nutrient intakes in ways that increase or decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. Candidate genetic variants that can lower serum HDL-C concentrations were explored by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), after adjusting for covariates, in the Ansan/Ansung cohort (n = 8842) from KoGES. The best genetic variants were selected and used to form a haplotype. According to the haplotype frequencies of SNPs, they were divided into major allele, heterozygote allele, and minor allele. The association of haplotype with serum HDL-C levels was determined using logistic regression after adjusting for confounding factors. Interaction of the haplotype with nutrient intake was also determined. PTPN11_rs11066325, RPH3A_rs886477 and OAS3_rs2072134 were selected to modulate serum HDL-C levels from GWAS(P = 1.09E-09, 7.04E-10, and 1.27E-09, respectively). The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for a decrease in serum HDL-C concentration in the minor-allele group of the haplotype were elevated by 1.534 fold, compared to the major-allele group of the haplotype. Furthermore, the adjusted ORs for serum LDL cholesterol and levels increased by 1.645 in the minor-alleles compared to the major-alleles of the haplotype without a significant change of serum cholesterol levels. Interestingly, the adjusted ORs for serum triglyceride were lower in the minor-alleles than in the major-alleles. The haplotype had a significant interaction with the intake of protein, fat, saturated fatty acids (SAF) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; P < 0.05). In particular, the minor alleles of the haplotype decreased serum HDL-C levels compared to the major-alleles in the high intake of protein, fat, SFA, and PUFA, not in the low intake. People carrying the minor-allele of haplotypes should avoid diets that are high in protein and fat, especially rich in SFA and PUFA.	
30952644	Clinical and Genome-wide Analysis of Cisplatin-induced Tinnitus Implicates Novel Ototoxic Mechanisms.	Cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic, results in tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound. Our purpose was to identify the clinical and genetic determinants of tinnitus among testicular cancer survivors (TCS) following cisplatin-based chemotherapy. TCS ((n) = 762) were dichotomized to cases (moderate/severe tinnitus;(n) = 154) and controls (none;(n) = 608). Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with comorbidities and SNP dosages in genome-wide association study (GWAS) following quality control and imputation (covariates: age, noise exposure, cisplatin dose, genetic principal components). Pathway over-representation tests and functional studies in mouse auditory cells were performed. Cisplatin-induced tinnitus (CisIT) significantly associated with age at diagnosis ((P) = 0.007) and cumulative cisplatin dose ((P) = 0.007). CisIT prevalence was not significantly greater in 400 mg/m(2)-treated TCS compared with 300 ((P) = 0.41), but doses >400 mg/m(2) (median 580, range 402-828) increased risk by 2.61-fold ((P) < 0.0001). CisIT cases had worse hearing at each frequency (0.25-12 kHz,(P) < 0.0001), and reported more vertigo (OR = 6.47;(P) < 0.0001) and problems hearing in a crowd (OR = 8.22;(P) < 0.0001) than controls. Cases reported poorer health ((P) < 0.0001) and greater psychotropic medication use (OR = 2.4;(P) = 0.003). GWAS suggested a variant near(OTOS) (rs7606353,(P) = 2 × 10(-6)) and(OTOS) eQTLs were significantly enriched independently of that SNP ((P) = 0.018).(OTOS) overexpression in HEI-OC1, a mouse auditory cell line, resulted in resistance to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Pathway analysis implicated potassium ion transport (q = 0.007). CisIT associated with several neuro-otological symptoms, increased use of psychotropic medication, and poorer health.(OTOS), expressed in the cochlear lateral wall, was implicated as protective. Future studies should investigate otoprotective targets in supporting cochlear cells.	
30952852	Genetic studies of accelerometer-based sleep measures yield new insights into human sleep behaviour.	Sleep is an essential human function but its regulation is poorly understood. Using accelerometer data from 85,670 UK Biobank participants, we perform a genome-wide association study of 8 derived sleep traits representing sleep quality, quantity and timing, and validate our findings in 5,819 individuals. We identify 47 genetic associations at P < 5 × 10(-8), of which 20 reach a stricter threshold of P < 8 × 10(-10). These include 26 novel associations with measures of sleep quality and 10 with nocturnal sleep duration. The majority of identified variants associate with a single sleep trait, except for variants previously associated with restless legs syndrome. For sleep duration we identify a missense variant (p.Tyr727Cys) in PDE11A as the likely causal variant. As a group, sleep quality loci are enriched for serotonin processing genes. Although accelerometer-derived measures of sleep are imperfect and may be affected by restless legs syndrome, these findings provide new biological insights into sleep compared to previous efforts based on self-report sleep measures.	
30955190	Genetic risk score raises the risk of incidence of chronic kidney disease in Korean general population-based cohort.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common disease, affecting about 10% of the general population. The genetic component about CKD incidence in Asian population is not well known. The aim of the study is to find the genetic loci associated with incident CKD and to figure out the effect of genetic variation on the development of CKD. We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study regarding the development of CKD based on two population-based cohorts of Korean Genome Epidemiology Study. 3617 Koreans from two different cohorts, aged 40-49 years without CKD at initial visit, were included in our analysis. We used 2510 individuals in Ansan as the discovery set and another 1107 individuals from Ansung as the replication set. At baseline, members of both cohorts provided information on creatinine, and DNA samples were collected for genotyping. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that surpassed a significance threshold of P < 5 × 10(-3) were selected. A total of 281 among 3617 developed CKD during the follow-up period. Incident CKD group was older (P < 0.001), included more female (P < 0.001), and had more hypertension and diabetes (P < 0.001). We identified 12 SNPs that are associated with incident CKD in the GWA study and made genetic risk score using these SNPs. In multiple Cox regression analysis, genetic risk score was still a significant associated factor (HR 1.311, CI 1.201, 1.431, P < 0.001). We identified several loci highly associated with incident CKD. The findings suggest the need for further investigations on the genetic propensity for incident CKD.	
30957308	Parkinson's disease age at onset genome-wide association study: Defining heritability, genetic loci, and α-synuclein mechanisms.	Increasing evidence supports an extensive and complex genetic contribution to PD. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light on the genetic basis of risk for this disease. However, the genetic determinants of PD age at onset are largely unknown. To identify the genetic determinants of PD age at onset. Using genetic data of 28,568 PD cases, we performed a genome-wide association study based on PD age at onset. We estimated that the heritability of PD age at onset attributed to common genetic variation was ∼0.11, lower than the overall heritability of risk for PD (∼0.27), likely, in part, because of the subjective nature of this measure. We found two genome-wide significant association signals, one at SNCA and the other a protein-coding variant in TMEM175, both of which are known PD risk loci and a Bonferroni-corrected significant effect at other known PD risk loci, GBA, INPP5F/BAG3, FAM47E/SCARB2, and MCCC1. Notably, SNCA, TMEM175, SCARB2, BAG3, and GBA have all been shown to be implicated in α-synuclein aggregation pathways. Remarkably, other well-established PD risk loci, such as GCH1 and MAPT, did not show a significant effect on age at onset of PD. Overall, we have performed the largest age at onset of PD genome-wide association studies to date, and our results show that not all PD risk loci influence age at onset with significant differences between risk alleles for age at onset. This provides a compelling picture, both within the context of functional characterization of disease-linked genetic variability and in defining differences between risk alleles for age at onset, or frank risk for disease. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.	
30993211	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies multiple novel loci associated with serum uric acid levels in Japanese individuals.	Gout is a common arthritis caused by elevated serum uric acid (SUA) levels. Here we investigated loci influencing SUA in a genome-wide meta-analysis with 121,745 Japanese subjects. We identified 8948 variants at 36 genomic loci ((P)<5 × 10(-8)) including eight novel loci. Of these, missense variants of(SESN2) and(PNPLA3) were predicted to be damaging to the function of these proteins; another five loci-(TMEM18),(TM4SF4),(MXD3-LMAN2),(PSORS1C1-PSORS1C2), and(HNF4A)-are related to cell metabolism, proliferation, or oxidative stress; and the remaining locus,(LINC01578), is unknown. We also identified 132 correlated genes whose expression levels are associated with SUA-increasing alleles. These genes are enriched for the UniProt transport term, suggesting the importance of transport-related genes in SUA regulation. Furthermore, trans-ethnic meta-analysis across our own meta-analysis and the Global Urate Genetics Consortium has revealed 15 more novel loci associated with SUA. Our findings provide insight into the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of hyperuricemia/gout.	
31070453	Genetic Association of Finger Photoplethysmography-Derived Arterial Stiffness Index With Blood Pressure and Coronary Artery Disease.	Objective- Arterial stiffness index (ASI) is independently associated with blood pressure (BP) and coronary artery disease (CAD) epidemiologically. However, it is unknown whether these associations represent causal relationships. Here, we assess whether genetic predisposition to increased ASI is associated with elevated BP and CAD risk. Approach and Results- We first performed a large-scale epidemiological association of finger photoplethysmography-derived ASI in the UK Biobank, finding significant associations with systolic BP (β=0.55 mm Hg; [95% CI, 0.45-0.65]; P=5.77×10(-24); N=137 858), diastolic BP (β=1.05 mm Hg; [95% CI, 0.99-1.11]; P=7.27×10(-272); N=137 862), and incident CAD (hazard ratio, 1.08; [95% CI, 1.04-1.11]; P=1.5×10(-6); N=3692 cases, 126 615 controls) in multivariable models. We then performed an ASI genome-wide association study analysis in 131 686 participants from the UK Biobank. Across participants not in the ASI genome-wide association study, a 6-variant ASI polygenic risk score was calculated. Each SD increase in genetic ASI was associated with systolic BP (β=4.63 mm Hg; [95% CI, 2.1-7.2]; P=3.37×10(-4); N=208 897), and diastolic BP (β=2.61 mm Hg; [95% CI, 1.2-4.0]; P=2.85×10(-4); N=208 897); however, no association was observed with incident CAD (hazard ratio, 1.12; [95% CI, 0.55-2.3]; P=0.75; N=223 061; 7534 cases). The lack of CAD association observed was replicated among 184 305 participants (60 810 cases) from the CARDIOGRAMplusC4D (Coronary Artery Disease Genetics Consortium; odds ratio, 0.56; [95% CI, 0.26-1.24]; P=0.15). Conclusions- Our data support the conclusion that finger photoplethysmography-derived ASI is an independent, genetically causal risk factor for BP, but do not support the notion that ASI is a suitable surrogate for CAD risk.	
30975718	Novel Risk Loci Identified in a Genome-Wide Association Study of Urolithiasis in a Japanese Population.	A family history of urolithiasis is associated with a more than doubling of urolithiasis risk, and a twin study estimating 56% heritability of the condition suggests a pivotal role for host genetic factors. However, previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only six risk-related loci. To identify novel urolithiasis-related loci in the Japanese population, we performed a large-scale GWAS of 11,130 cases and 187,639 controls, followed by a replication analysis of 2289 cases and 3817 controls. Diagnosis of urolithiasis was confirmed either by a clinician or using medical records or self-report. We also assessed the association of urolithiasis loci with 16 quantitative traits, including metabolic, kidney-related, and electrolyte traits (such as body mass index, lipid storage, eGFR, serum uric acid, and serum calcium), using up to 160,000 samples from BioBank Japan. The analysis identified 14 significant loci, including nine novel loci. Ten regions showed a significant association with at least one quantitative trait, including metabolic, kidney-related, and electrolyte traits, suggesting a common genetic basis for urolithiasis and these quantitative traits. Four novel loci were related to metabolic traits, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, or hyperuricemia. The remaining ten loci were associated with kidney- or electrolyte-related traits; these may affect crystallization. Weighted genetic risk score analysis indicated that the highest risk group (top 20%) showed an odds ratio of 1.71 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 2.06) - 2.13 (95% confidence interval, 2.00 to 2.27) compared with the reference group (bottom 20%). Our findings provide evidence that host genetic factors related to regulation of metabolic and crystallization pathways contribute to the development of urolithiasis.	
30980028	The molecular genetics of hand preference revisited.	Hand preference is a prominent behavioural trait linked to human brain asymmetry. A handful of genetic variants have been reported to associate with hand preference or quantitative measures related to it. Most of these reports were on the basis of limited sample sizes, by current standards for genetic analysis of complex traits. Here we performed a genome-wide association analysis of hand preference in the large, population-based UK Biobank cohort (N = 331,037). We used gene-set enrichment analysis to investigate whether genes involved in visceral asymmetry are particularly relevant to hand preference, following one previous report. We found no evidence supporting any of the previously suggested variants or genes, nor that genes involved in visceral laterality have a role in hand preference. It remains possible that some of the previously reported genes or pathways are relevant to hand preference as assessed in other ways, or else are relevant within specific disorder populations. However, some or all of the earlier findings are likely to be false positives, and none of them appear relevant to hand preference as defined categorically in the general population. Our analysis did produce a small number of novel, significant associations, including one implicating the microtubule-associated gene MAP2 in handedness.	
30995994	Multivariate genome-wide association study of rapid automatised naming and rapid alternating stimulus in Hispanic American and African-American youth.	Rapid automatised naming (RAN) and rapid alternating stimulus (RAS) are reliable predictors of reading disability. The underlying biology of reading disability is poorly understood. However, the high correlation among RAN, RAS and reading could be attributable to shared genetic factors that contribute to common biological mechanisms. To identify shared genetic factors that contribute to RAN and RAS performance using a multivariate approach. We conducted a multivariate genome-wide association analysis of RAN Objects, RAN Letters and RAS Letters/Numbers in a sample of 1331 Hispanic American and African-American youth. Follow-up neuroimaging genetic analysis of cortical regions associated with reading ability in an independent sample and epigenetic examination of extant data predicting tissue-specific functionality in the brain were also conducted. Genome-wide significant effects were observed at rs1555839 (p=4.03×10(-8)) and replicated in an independent sample of 318 children of European ancestry. Epigenetic analysis and chromatin state models of the implicated 70 kb region of 10q23.31 support active transcription of the gene(RNLS) in the brain, which encodes a catecholamine metabolising protein. Chromatin contact maps of adult hippocampal tissue indicate a potential enhancer-promoter interaction regulating(RNLS) expression. Neuroimaging genetic analysis in an independent, multiethnic sample (n=690) showed that rs1555839 is associated with structural variation in the right inferior parietal lobule. This study provides support for a novel trait locus at chromosome 10q23.31 and proposes a potential gene-brain-behaviour relationship for targeted future functional analysis to understand underlying biological mechanisms for reading disability.	
31015401	Genome-wide association study of medication-use and associated disease in the UK Biobank.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of medication use may contribute to understanding of disease etiology, could generate new leads relevant for drug discovery and can be used to quantify future risk of medication taking. Here, we conduct GWASs of self-reported medication use from 23 medication categories in approximately 320,000 individuals from the UK Biobank. A total of 505 independent genetic loci that meet stringent criteria (P < 10(-8)/23) for statistical significance are identified. We investigate the implications of these GWAS findings in relation to biological mechanism, potential drug target identification and genetic risk stratification of disease. Amongst the medication-associated genes are 16 known therapeutic-effect target genes for medications from 9 categories. Two of the medication classes studied are for disorders that have not previously been subject to large GWAS (hypothyroidism and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease).	
31015462	Sex-specific and pleiotropic effects underlying kidney function identified from GWAS meta-analysis.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing health burden currently affecting 10-15% of adults worldwide. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a marker of kidney function is commonly used to diagnose CKD. We analyze eGFR data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and Michigan Genomics Initiative and perform a GWAS meta-analysis with public summary statistics, more than doubling the sample size of previous meta-analyses. We identify 147 loci (53 novel) associated with eGFR, including genes involved in transcriptional regulation, kidney development, cellular signaling, metabolism, and solute transport. Additionally, sex-stratified analysis identifies one locus with more significant effects in women than men. Using genetic risk scores constructed from these eGFR meta-analysis results, we show that associated variants are generally predictive of CKD with only modest improvements in detection compared with other known clinical risk factors. Collectively, these results yield additional insight into the genetic factors underlying kidney function and progression to CKD.	
31020675	Integrative genome analysis identified the KANNO blood group antigen as prion protein.	Anti-KANNO, a broadly reactive RBC alloantibody, is found among some Japanese pregnant women, but the genetic basis of the corresponding antigen remains unclear. We integrated a statistical approach to identify the coding gene for KANNO antigen by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on four KANNO-negative individuals and 415 healthy Japanese. We also applied whole-exome sequencing to them and performed a replication study to confirm the identified genome variation using independent 14 KANNO-negative individuals. A monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of erythrocyte antigens (MAIEA) assay was used to locate KANNO antigen on RBC-specific membrane protein. In vivo and in vitro binding assays of anti-KANNO were further applied to the cells expressing a candidate protein. The GWAS revealed a genome-wide significant association of chromosome 20p13 locus (p = 2.76E-08; odds ratio > 1000 [95% confidence interval = 48-23,674]). The identified single-nucleotide polymorphism located in an intronic region of the prion protein (PRNP) gene. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a missense variant in the PRNP gene (rs1800014, E219K), which is in linkage disequilibrium with the single-nucleotide polymorphism identified in the GWAS. All 18 KANNO-negative individuals possessed the homozygous genotype of the missense variant. The MAIEA assay using anti-KANNO and mouse antihuman prion protein showed a clear difference between KANNO-positive and KANNO-negative RBCs. Anti-KANNO showed direct binding to CHO-K1 cells expressing wild-type PRNP but not to those expressing E219K PRNP. We first identified the coding gene of the high-frequency antigen KANNO located in PRNP and the missense variation (E219K) that affects the seropositivity of the KANNO antigen, which were confirmed by PRNP overexpressed cells.	
31059154	Genome-wide survey of copy number variants finds MAPT duplications in progressive supranuclear palsy.	Progressive supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative tauopathy manifesting clinically as a progressive akinetic-rigid syndrome. In this study, we sought to identify genetic variants influencing PSP susceptibility through a genome-wide association analysis of a cohort of well-characterized patients who had participated in the Neuroprotection and Natural History in Parkinson Plus Syndromes and Blood Brain Barrier in Parkinson Plus Syndromes studies. We genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 283 PSP cases from the United Kingdom, Germany, and France and compared these with genotypes from 4472 controls. Copy number variants were identified from genotyping data. We observed associations on chromosome 17 within or close to the MAPT gene and explored the genetic architecture at this locus. We confirmed the previously reported association of rs1768208 in the MOBP gene (P = 3.29 × 10(-13) ) and rs1411478 in STX6 (P = 3.45 × 10(-10) ). The population-attributable risk from the MAPT, MOBP, and STX6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms was found to be 0.37, 0.26, and 0.08, respectively. In addition, we found 2 instances of copy number variants spanning the MAPT gene in patients with PSP. These copy number variants include tau but few other genes within the chromosome 17 haplotype region, providing additional support for the direct pathogenicity of MAPT in PSP. Clinicians should also be aware of MAPT duplication as a possible genetic cause of PSP, especially in patients presenting with young age at onset. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.	
31065058	GBA and APOE ε4 associate with sporadic dementia with Lewy bodies in European genome wide association study.	Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with poor prognosis and mainly unknown pathophysiology. Heritability estimates exceed 30% but few genetic risk variants have been identified. Here we investigated common genetic variants associated with DLB in a large European multisite sample. We performed a genome wide association study in Norwegian and European cohorts of 720 DLB cases and 6490 controls and included 19 top-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms in an additional cohort of 108 DLB cases and 75545 controls from Iceland. Overall the study included 828 DLB cases and 82035 controls. Variants in the ASH1L/GBA (Chr1q22) and APOE ε4 (Chr19) loci were associated with DLB surpassing the genome-wide significance threshold (p < 5 × 10(-8)). One additional genetic locus previously linked to psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, ZFPM1 (Chr16q24.2), showed suggestive association with DLB at p-value < 1 × 10(-6). We report two susceptibility loci for DLB at genome-wide significance, providing insight into etiological factors. These findings highlight the complex relationship between the genetic architecture of DLB and other neurodegenerative disorders.	
31070104	Genetic Determinants of Circulating Glycine Levels and Risk of Coronary Artery Disease.	Background Recent studies have revealed sexually dimorphic associations between the carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 locus, intermediates of the metabolic pathway leading from choline to urea, and risk of coronary artery disease ( CAD ) in women. Based on evidence from the literature, the atheroprotective association with carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 could be mediated by the strong genetic effect of this locus on increased circulating glycine levels. Methods and Results We sought to identify additional genetic determinants of circulating glycine levels by carrying out a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data in up to 30 118 subjects of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization and other analytical approaches were used to determine whether glycine-associated variants were associated with CAD and traditional risk factors. Twelve loci were significantly associated with circulating glycine levels, 7 of which were not previously known to be involved in glycine metabolism ( ACADM , PHGDH , COX 18- ADAMTS 3, PSPH , TRIB 1, PTPRD , and ABO ). Glycine-raising alleles at several loci individually exhibited directionally consistent associations with decreased risk of CAD . However, these effects could not be attributed directly to glycine because of associations with other CAD -related traits. By comparison, genetic models that only included the 2 variants directly involved in glycine degradation and for which there were no other pleiotropic associations were not associated with risk of CAD or blood pressure, lipid levels, and obesity-related traits. Conclusions These results provide additional insight into the genetic architecture of glycine metabolism, but do not yield conclusive evidence for a causal relationship between circulating levels of this amino acid and risk of CAD in humans.	
31085060	Genome-wide analysis of emotional lability in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	Emotional lability is strongly associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), represents a major source of impairment and predicts poor clinical outcome in ADHD. Given that no specific genes with a role in the co-occurrence of both conditions have been described, we conducted a GWAS of emotional lability in 563 adults with ADHD. Despite not reaching genome-wide significance, the results highlighted genes related with neurotransmission, cognitive function and a wide range of psychiatric disorders that have emotional lability as common clinical feature. By constructing polygenic risk scores on mood instability in the UK Biobank sample and assessing their association with emotional lability in our clinical dataset, we found suggestive evidence of common genetic variation contributing to emotional lability in general population and in clinically diagnosed ADHD. Although not conclusive, these tentative results are in agreement with previous studies that suggest emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic construct and highlight the need for further investigation to disentangle the genetic basis of mood instability in ADHD and co-occurring psychiatric disorders.	
31081985	Genome-wide analyses of psychological resilience in U.S. Army soldiers.	Though a growing body of preclinical and translational research is illuminating a biological basis for resilience to stress, little is known about the genetic basis of psychological resilience in humans. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of self-assessed (by questionnaire) and outcome-based (incident mental disorders from predeployment to postdeployment) resilience among European (EUR) ancestry soldiers in the Army study to assess risk and resilience in servicemembers. Self-assessed resilience (N = 11,492) was found to have significant common-variant heritability (h(2) = 0.162, se = 0.050, p = 5.37 × 10(-4) ), and to be significantly negatively genetically correlated with neuroticism (r(g)  = -0.388, p = .0092). GWAS results from the EUR soldiers revealed a genome-wide significant locus on an intergenic region on Chr 4 upstream from doublecortin-like kinase 2 (DCLK2) (four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LD; top SNP: rs4260523 [p = 5.65 × 10(-9) ] is an eQTL in frontal cortex), a member of the doublecortin family of kinases that promote survival and regeneration of injured neurons. A second gene, kelch-like family member 36 (KLHL36) was detected at gene-wise genome-wide significance [p = 1.89 × 10(-6) ]. A polygenic risk score derived from the self-assessed resilience GWAS was not significantly associated with outcome-based resilience. In very preliminary results, genome-wide significant association with outcome-based resilience was found for one locus (top SNP: rs12580015 [p = 2.37 × 10(-8) ]) on Chr 12 downstream from solute carrier family 15 member 5 (SLC15A5) in subjects (N = 581) exposed to the highest level of deployment stress. The further study of genetic determinants of resilience has the potential to illuminate the molecular bases of stress-related psychopathology and point to new avenues for therapeutic intervention.	
31089239	Genome-wide association study of right-sided colonic diverticulosis in a Korean population.	Diverticulosis results from complex interactions related to aging, environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Despite epidemiologic evidence of genetic risk factors, there has been no attempt to identify genes that confer susceptibility to colonic diverticulosis. We performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on susceptibility to diverticulosis in a Korean population. A GWAS was carried out in 7,948 healthy individuals: 893 patients and 1,075 controls comprised the test set, and 346 patients and 305 controls comprised the replication set. Diverticulosis was diagnosed by colonoscopy during comprehensive medical check-ups, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to diverticulosis were detected with the Affymetrix Axiom KORV1.1-96 Array. In all, 9 SNPs were identified in three SNP aggregates in the test set (P < 10(-3), within 200 kb) after adjusting for sex. All the SNPs were replicated in the replication set (P < 0.05). Three SNPs were near the WNT4 gene, four near the RHOU gene, and two in the OAS1/3 genes. The top SNP associated with right-sided colonic diverticulosis was rs22538787, located near the WNT4 gene [combined set, P-value = 3.128 × 10(-6), odds ratio = 1.415 (95% confidence interval: 1.223-1.637)]. These 9 novel SNP alleles associated with the WNT4, RHOU, and OAS1/3 genes are possibly involved in the underlying genetic susceptibility to right-sided diverticulosis. Our results provide basic knowledge about the development of diverticulosis in an Asian population.	
31092297	Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci for type 2 diabetes-attributed end-stage kidney disease in African Americans.	End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a significant public health concern disproportionately affecting African Americans (AAs). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading cause of ESKD in the USA, and efforts to uncover genetic susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) have had limited success. A prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) in AAs with T2D-ESKD was expanded with additional AA cases and controls and genotypes imputed to the higher density 1000 Genomes reference panel. The discovery analysis included 3432 T2D-ESKD cases and 6977 non-diabetic non-nephropathy controls (N = 10,409), followed by a discrimination analysis in 2756 T2D non-nephropathy controls to exclude T2D-associated variants. Six independent variants located in or near RND3/RBM43, SLITRK3, ENPP7, GNG7, and APOL1 achieved genome-wide significant association (P < 5 × 10(-8)) with T2D-ESKD. Following extension analyses in 1910 non-diabetic ESKD cases and 908 non-diabetic non-nephropathy controls, a meta-analysis of 5342 AA all-cause ESKD cases and 6977 AA non-diabetic non-nephropathy controls revealed an additional novel all-cause ESKD locus at EFNB2 (rs77113398; P = 9.84 × 10(-9); OR = 1.94). Exclusion of APOL1 renal-risk genotype carriers identified two additional genome-wide significant T2D-ESKD-associated loci at GRAMD3 and MGAT4C. A second variant at GNG7 (rs373971520; P = 2.17 × 10(-8), OR = 1.46) remained associated with all-cause ESKD in the APOL1-negative analysis. Findings provide further evidence for genetic factors associated with advanced kidney disease in AAs with T2D.	
31102405	A genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for primary central nervous system lymphoma at 6p25.3 and 3p22.1: a LOC network study.	Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of extra-nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma. PCNSL is a distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with over 95% of tumors belonging to the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) group. We have conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on immunocompetent patients to address the possibility that common genetic variants influence the risk of developing PCNSL. We performed a meta-analysis of two new genome-wide association studies of PCNSL totaling 475 cases and 1,134 controls of European ancestry. To increase genomic resolution, we imputed >10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the 1000 Genomes Project combined with UK10K as reference. In addition we performed a transcription factor binding disruption analysis and investigated the patterns of local chromatin patterns by capture Hi-C data. We identified independent risk loci at 3p22.1 (rs41289586, ANO10, P = 2.17 x 10-8) and 6p25.3 near EXOC2 (rs116446171, P = 1.95 x 10-13). In contrast the lack of an association between rs41289586 and DLBCL, suggests distinct germline predisposition to PCNSL and DLBCL. We found looping chromatin interactions between non-coding regions at 6p25.3 (rs11646171) with the IRF4 promoter and at 8q24.21 (rs13254990) with the MYC promoter, both genes with strong relevance to B-cell tumorigenesis. To our knowledge this is the first study providing insight into the genetic predisposition to PCNSL. Our findings represent an important step in defining the contribution of common genetic variation to the risk of developing PCNSL.	
31109976	Genomewide Association Study Confirming the Association of 	Antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI) is a common side effect leading to tuberculosis (TB) treatment disruption. The mechanism of the disease remains poorly understood. We conducted a genomewide association study (GWAS) to investigate all possible genetic factors of ATDILI in Thai patients. This study was carried out in Thai TB patients, including 79 ATDILI cases and 239 tolerant controls from our network hospitals in Thailand. Nearly 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped across the whole genome using an Illumina OmniExpress Exome BeadChip array. In the discovery stage, we identified strong association signals on chromosome 8 originating from the(N)-acetyltransferase ((NAT2)) region. The A allele of rs1495741, the top SNP in the intergenic region of(NAT2) and(PSD3) (14 kb from(NAT2)), was significantly associated with ATDILI (recessive model, odds ratio of 6.01 [95% confidence interval, 3.42 to 10.57];(P) = 6.86E-11). This particular SNP was reported as a tag SNP for(NAT2) inferred phenotypes. The AA, AG, and GG genotypes represented(NAT2) slow acetylators, intermediate acetylators, and fast acetylators, respectively. The tag SNP genotypes demonstrated a concordance rate of 94.98% with(NAT2) acetylator phenotypes. This GWAS shows that(NAT2) is the most important risk factor for ATDILI in the Thai population.
