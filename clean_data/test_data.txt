30003630	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of age at first cannabis use.	Cannabis is one of the most commonly used substances among adolescents and young adults. Earlier age at cannabis initiation is linked to adverse life outcomes, including multi-substance use and dependence. This study estimated the heritability of age at first cannabis use and identified associations with genetic variants. A twin-based heritability analysis using 8055 twins from three cohorts was performed. We then carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis of age at first cannabis use in a discovery sample of 24 953 individuals from nine European, North American and Australian cohorts, and a replication sample of 3735 individuals. The twin-based heritability for age at first cannabis use was 38% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 19-60%]. Shared and unique environmental factors explained 39% (95% CI = 20-56%) and 22% (95% CI = 16-29%). The genome-wide association meta-analysis identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 16 within the calcium-transporting ATPase gene (ATP2C2) at P < 5E-08. All five SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2)  > 0.8), with the strongest association at the intronic variant rs1574587 (P = 4.09E-09). Gene-based tests of association identified the ATP2C2 gene on 16q24.1 (P = 1.33e-06). Although the five SNPs and ATP2C2 did not replicate, ATP2C2 has been associated with cocaine dependence in a previous study. ATP2B2, which is a member of the same calcium signalling pathway, has been associated previously with opioid dependence. SNP-based heritability for age at first cannabis use was non-significant. Age at cannabis initiation appears to be moderately heritable in western countries, and individual differences in onset can be explained by separate but correlated genetic liabilities. The significant association between age of initiation and ATP2C2 is consistent with the role of calcium signalling mechanisms in substance use disorders.
30009487	Genome-wide association study: Exploring the genetic basis for responsiveness to ketogenic dietary therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy.	With the exception of specific metabolic disorders, predictors of response to ketogenic dietary therapies (KDTs) are unknown. We aimed to determine whether common variation across the genome influences the response to KDT for epilepsy. We genotyped individuals who were negative for glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome or other metabolic disorders, who received KDT for epilepsy. Genotyping was performed with the Infinium HumanOmniExpressExome Beadchip. Hospital records were used to obtain demographic and clinical data. KDT response (≥50% seizure reduction) at 3-month follow-up was used to dissect out nonresponders and responders. We then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in nonresponders vs responders, using a linear mixed model and correcting for population stratification. Variants with minor allele frequency <0.05 and those that did not pass quality control filtering were excluded. After quality control filtering, the GWAS of 112 nonresponders vs 123 responders revealed an association locus at 6p25.1, 61 kb upstream of CDYL (rs12204701, P = 3.83 × 10(-8) , odds ratio [A] = 13.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.07-44.8). Although analysis of regional linkage disequilibrium around rs12204701 did not strengthen the likelihood of CDYL being the candidate gene, additional bioinformatic analyses suggest it is the most likely candidate. CDYL deficiency has been shown to disrupt neuronal migration and to influence susceptibility to epilepsy in mice. Further exploration with a larger replication cohort is warranted to clarify whether CDYL is the causal gene underlying the association signal.
30013178	Common variation near IRF6 is associated with IFN-β-induced liver injury in multiple sclerosis.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system treated with disease-modifying therapies, including the biologic, interferon-β (IFN-β). Up to 60% of IFN-β-exposed MS patients develop abnormal biochemical liver test results(1,2), and 1 in 50 experiences drug-induced liver injury(3). Since genomic variation contributes to other forms of drug-induced liver injury(4,5), we aimed to identify biomarkers of IFN-β-induced liver injury using a two-stage genome-wide association study. The rs2205986 variant, previously linked to differential expression of IRF6, surpassed genome-wide significance in the combined two-stage analysis (P = 2.3 × 10(-8), odds ratio = 8.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.6-19.2). Analysis of an independent cohort of IFN-β-treated MS patients identified via electronic medical records showed that rs2205986 was also associated with increased peak levels of aspartate aminotransferase (P = 7.6 × 10(-5)) and alkaline phosphatase (P = 4.9 × 10(-4)). We show that these findings may be applicable to predicting IFN-β-induced liver injury, offering insight into its safer use.
30012571	Strong Association of the 	(Background) Nephrotic syndrome is the most common cause of chronic glomerular disease in children. Most of these patients develop steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS), but the loci conferring susceptibility to childhood SSNS are mainly unknown.(Methods) We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Japanese population; 224 patients with childhood SSNS and 419 adult healthy controls were genotyped using the Affymetrix Japonica Array in the discovery stage. Imputation for six(HLA) genes ((HLA-A),(-C, -B),(-DRB1),(-DQB1), and(-DPB1)) was conducted on the basis of Japanese-specific references. We performed genotyping for(HLA-DRB1)/-(DQB1) using a sequence-specific oligonucleotide-probing method on a Luminex platform. Whole-genome imputation was conducted using a phased reference panel of 2049 healthy Japanese individuals. Replication was performed in an independent Japanese sample set including 216 patients and 719 healthy controls. We genotyped candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms using the DigiTag2 assay.(Results) The most significant association was detected in the(HLA-DR/DQ) region and replicated (rs4642516 [minor allele G], combined(P)(allelic)=7.84×10(-23); odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.26 to 0.41; rs3134996 [minor allele A], combined(P)(allelic)=1.72×10(-25); OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.37).(HLA-DRB1*08:02) ((Pc)=1.82×10(-9); OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.94 to 3.54) and(HLA-DQB1*06:04) ((Pc)=2.09×10(-12); OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.21) were considered primary(HLA) alleles associated with childhood SSNS.(HLA-DRB1*08:02-DQB1*03:02) ((Pc)=7.01×10(-11); OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 2.46 to 5.29) was identified as the most significant genetic susceptibility factor.(Conclusions) The most significant association with childhood SSNS was detected in the(HLA-DR/DQ) region. Further(HLA) allele/haplotype analyses should enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying SSNS.
30014611	Long-range genomic regulators of THBS1 and LTBP4 modify disease severity in duchenne muscular dystrophy.	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disease caused by loss-of-function dystrophin (DMD) mutations in boys, who typically suffer loss of ambulation by age 12. Previously, we reported that coding variants in latent transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-binding protein 4 (LTBP4) were associated with reduced TGFβ signaling and prolonged ambulation (p = 1.0 × 10(-3) ) in DMD patients; this result was subsequently replicated by other groups. In this study, we evaluated whether additional DMD modifier genes are observed using whole-genome association in the original cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing loss of ambulation (LOA) in the same cohort of 253 DMD patients used to detect the candidate association with LTBP4 coding variants. Gene expression and chromatin interaction databases were used to fine-map association signals above the threshold for genome-wide significance. Despite the small sample size, two loci associated with prolonged ambulation met genome-wide significance and were tagged by rs2725797 (chr15, p = 6.6 × 10(-9) ) and rs710160 (chr19, p = 4.7 × 10(-8) ). Gene expression and chromatin interaction data indicated that the latter SNP tags regulatory variants of LTBP4, whereas the former SNP tags regulatory variants of thrombospondin-1 (THBS1): an activator of TGFβ signaling by direct binding to LTBP4 and an inhibitor of proangiogenic nitric oxide signaling. Together with previous evidence implicating LTBP4, the THBS1 modifier locus emphasizes the role that common regulatory variants in gene interaction networks can play in mitigating disease progression in muscular dystrophy. Ann Neurol 2018;84:234-245.
30031151	Noncoding RET variants explain the strong association with Hirschsprung disease in patients without rare coding sequence variant.	The pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease is complex. Although the RET proto-oncogene is the most frequently affected gene in Hirschsprung disease, rare coding sequence variants explain only a small part of Hirschsprung disease cases. We aimed to assess the genetic background of Hirschsprung disease using a genome-wide association analysis combined with sequencing all RET exons in samples from 105 Hirschsprung disease cases (30 familial and 75 sporadic) and 386 controls. As expected, variants in or near RET showed the strongest overall association with Hirschsprung disease and the most statistically significant association was observed when using a recessive genetic model (rs2435357, NC_000010.10:g.43582056T > C; genotype TT, OR = 17.31, P = 1.462 × 10(-21)). Previously published associations in variants in SEMA (rs11766001, NC_000007.13:g.84145202A > C; allele C, OR = 2.268, P = 0.009533) and NRG1 (rs4541858, NC_000008.10:g.32410309A > G; allele G, OR = 1.567, P = 0.015; rs7835688, NC_000008.10:g.32411499G > C; allele C, OR = 1.567, P = 0.015) were also replicated in the genome-wide association analysis. Sequencing revealed a total of 12 exonic RET rare variants. Of these, eight amino acid changing rare variants and two frameshift variants caused or possibly caused Hirschsprung disease. Only a minority of the Hirschsprung disease cases (9/30 familial; 7/75 sporadic) carried one of the rare variants. Excluding the rare variant carriers from the genome-wide association analysis did not appreciably change the association of rs2435357 with Hirschsprung disease. We estimate that approximately two thirds of the sporadic cases may be statistically attributed to the recessive action of the common non-coding RET variants. Thus, even though most cases do not carry rare RET variants, combinations of rare variants and the common non-coding RET variant cause the majority of the cases in our population.
30054556	Genome-wide association study suggests four variants influencing outcomes with ranibizumab therapy in exudative age-related macular degeneration.	To identify factors associated with ranibizumab responses in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a replication study using a total of 919 exudative AMD patients treated with intravitreal ranibizumab in a Japanese population. In the combined analysis of GWAS and the replication study, no loci reached genome-wide significant level; however, we found four variants showed suggestive level of associations with visual loss at month three (rs17822656, rs76150532, rs17296444, and rs75165563: P(combined) < 1.0 × 10(-5)). Of the candidate genes within these loci, three were relevant to VEGF-related pathway (KCNMA1, SOCS2, and OTX2). The proportions of patients who worsened visual acuity were 13.7%, 38.8%, 58.0%, and 80.0% in patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more identified risk variants, respectively. Changes in visual acuity decreased linearly as the number of risk variants increased (P = 1.67 × 10(-12)). The area under the curve using age, baseline visual acuity, and history of previous treatment was 0.607, and improved significantly to 0.713 in combination with identified variants (P < 0.0001). Although further study is needed to confirm their associations, our results offer candidate variants influencing response to ranibizumab therapy.
30066433	Variation at the TRIM11 locus modifies progressive supranuclear palsy phenotype.	The basis for clinical variation related to underlying progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) pathology is unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic determinants of PSP phenotype. Two independent pathological and clinically diagnosed PSP cohorts were genotyped and phenotyped to create Richardson syndrome (RS) and non-RS groups. We carried out separate logistic regression GWASs to compare RS and non-RS groups and then combined datasets to carry out a whole cohort analysis (RS = 367, non-RS = 130). We validated our findings in a third cohort by referring to data from 100 deeply phenotyped cases from a recent GWAS. We assessed the expression/coexpression patterns of our identified genes and used our data to carry out gene-based association testing. Our lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs564309, showed an association signal in both cohorts, reaching genome-wide significance in our whole cohort analysis (odds ratio = 5.5, 95% confidence interval = 3.2-10.0, p = 1.7 × 10(-9) ). rs564309 is an intronic variant of the tripartite motif-containing protein 11 (TRIM11) gene, a component of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). In our third cohort, minor allele frequencies of surrogate SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with rs564309 replicated our findings. Gene-based association testing confirmed an association signal at TRIM11. We found that TRIM11 is predominantly expressed neuronally, in the cerebellum and basal ganglia. Our study suggests that the TRIM11 locus is a genetic modifier of PSP phenotype and potentially adds further evidence for the UPS having a key role in tau pathology, therefore representing a target for disease-modifying therapies. Ann Neurol 2018;84:485-496.
30369316	Variants at the APOE /C1/C2/C4 Locus Modulate Cholesterol Efflux Capacity Independently of High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol.	Background Macrophage cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoproteins ( HDLs ) is the first step of reverse cholesterol transport. The cholesterol efflux capacity ( CEC ) of HDL particles is a protective risk factor for coronary artery disease independent of HDL cholesterol levels. Using a genome-wide association study approach, we aimed to identify pathways that regulate CEC in humans. Methods and Results We measured CEC in 5293 French Canadians. We tested the genetic association between 4 CEC measures and genotypes at >9 million common autosomal DNA sequence variants. These analyses yielded 10 genome-wide significant signals ( P<6.25×10(-9)) representing 7 loci. Five of these loci harbor genes with important roles in lipid biology ( CETP , LIPC , LPL , APOA 1/C3/A4/A5, and APOE /C1/C2/C4). Except for the APOE /C1/C2/C4 variant ( rs141622900, P(nonadjusted)=1.0×10(-11); P(adjusted)=8.8×10(-9)), the association signals disappear when correcting for HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The additional 2 significant signals were near the PPP 1 CB / PLB 1 and RBFOX 3/ ENPP 7 genes. In secondary analyses, we considered candidate functional variants for 58 genes implicated in HDL biology, as well as 239 variants associated with blood lipid levels and/or coronary artery disease risk by genome-wide association study . These analyses identified 27 significant CEC associations, implicating 5 additional loci ( GCKR , LIPG , PLTP , PPARA , and TRIB 1). Conclusions Our genome-wide association study identified common genetic variation at the APOE /C1/C2/C4 locus as a major determinant of CEC that acts largely independently of HDL cholesterol. We predict that HDL -based therapies aiming at increasing CEC will be modulated by changes in the expression of apolipoproteins in this gene cluster.
30068317	Genome-wide association study of lung function and clinical implication in heavy smokers.	The aim of this study is to identify genetic loci associated with post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC and FEV(1), and develop a multi-gene predictive model for lung function in COPD. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC and FEV(1) was performed in 1645 non-Hispanic White European descent smokers. A functional rare variant in SERPINA1 (rs28929474: Glu342Lys) was significantly associated with post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC (p = 1.2 × 10(- 8)) and FEV(1) (p = 2.1 × 10(- 9)). In addition, this variant was associated with COPD (OR = 2.3; p = 7.8 × 10(- 4)) and severity (OR = 4.1; p = 0.0036). Heterozygous subjects (CT genotype) had significantly lower lung function and higher percentage of COPD and more severe COPD than subjects with the CC genotype. 8.6% of the variance of post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC can be explained by SNPs in 10 genes with age, sex, and pack-years of cigarette smoking (P <  2.2 × 10(- 16)). This study is the first to show genome-wide significant association of rs28929474 in SERPINA1 with lung function. Of clinical importance, heterozygotes of rs28929474 (4.7% of subjects) have significantly reduced pulmonary function, demonstrating a major impact in smokers. The multi-gene model is significantly associated with CT-based emphysema and clinical outcome measures of severity. Combining genetic information with demographic and environmental factors will further increase the predictive power for assessing reduced lung function and COPD severity.
30073298	Role of the Complement System in Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy: A Genome-Wide Association Study.	To date, several targeted genetic studies on chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSC) have been performed; however, unbiased genome-wide studies into the genetics of cCSC have not been reported. To discover new genetic loci associated with cCSC and to better understand the causative mechanism of this disease, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on patients with cCSC. To discover new genetic loci and pathways associated with cCSC and to predict the association of genetic variants with gene expression in patients with cCSC. This case-control GWAS was completed in the general community, 3 referral university medical centers, and outpatient care on Europeans individuals with cCSC and population-based control participants. Genotype data was collected from May 2013 to August 2017, and data analysis occurred from August 2017 to November 2017. Associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, haplotypes, genetic pathways, and predicted gene expression with cCSC. A total of 521 patients with cCSC (median age, 51 years; interquartile range [IQR], 44-59 years; 420 [80.6%] male) and 3577 European population-based control participants (median age, 52 years; IQR, 37-71 years; 1630 [45.6%] male) were included. One locus on chromosome 1 at the complement factor H (CFH) gene reached genome-wide significance and was associated with an increased risk of cCSC (rs1329428; odds ratio [OR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.38-1.80]; P = 3.12 × 10-11). The CFH haplotypes H1 and H3 were protective for cCSC (H1: OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.53-0.77]; P = 2.18 × 10-6; H3: OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.42-0.70]; P = 2.49 × 10-6), whereas haplotypes H2, H4, H5, and the aggregate of rare CFH haplotypes conferred increased risk (H2: OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30-1.89]; P = 2.18 × 10-6; H4: OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.13-1.80]; P = 2.49 × 10-3; H5: OR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.36-2.39]; P = 4.61 × 10-5; rare haplotypes: OR, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.43-2.77]; P = 4.59 × 10-5). Pathway analyses showed involvement of the complement cascade and alternative open reading frame (ARF) pathway in cCSC. Using PrediXcan, we identified changes in predicted expression of complement genes CFH, complement factor H related 1 (CFHR1), complement factor related 4 (CFHR4), and membrane cofactor protein (MCP/CD46). Additionally, the potassium sodium-activated channel subfamily T member 2 (KCNT2) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10a (TNFRSF10A) genes were differentially expressed in patients with cCSC. In this GWAS on cCSC, we identified a locus on chromosome 1 at the CFH gene that was significantly associated with cCSC, and we report protective and risk-conferring haplotypes in this gene. Pathway analyses were enriched for complement genes, and gene expression analysis suggests a role for CFH, CFHR1, CFHR4, CD46, KCNT2, and TNFRSF10A in the disease. Taken together, these results underscore the potential importance of the complement pathway in the causative mechanisms of cCSC.
30099483	Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Distinct Genetic Susceptibility of Thyroid Nodules From Thyroid Cancer.	Thyroid nodules are very common, and 7% to 15% of them are diagnosed as thyroid cancer. However, the inherited genetic risk factors for thyroid nodules and their associations with thyroid cancer remain unknown. To identify the genetic variants associated with susceptibility to thyroid nodules in comparison with thyroid cancer. We performed a three-stage genome-wide association study for thyroid nodules. The discovery stage involved a genome-wide scan of 811 subjects with thyroid nodules and 691 subjects with a normal thyroid from a population-based cohort. Replication studies were conducted in an additional 1981 cases and 3100 controls from the participants of a health checkup. We also performed expression quantitative trait loci analysis of public data. The most robust association was observed in TRPM3 (rs4745021) in the joint analysis (OR, 1.26; P = 6.12 × 10-8) and meta-analysis (OR, 1.28; P = 2.11 × 10-8). Signals at MBIP/NKX2-1 were replicated but did not reach genome-wide significance in the joint analysis (rs2415317, P = 4.62 × 10-5; rs944289, P = 8.68 × 10-5). The expression quantitative trait loci analysis showed that TRPM3 expression was associated with the rs4745021 genotype in thyroid tissues. To the best of our knowledge, we have performed the first genome-wide association study of thyroid nodules and identified a susceptibility locus associated with thyroid nodules, suggesting that thyroid nodules have a genetic predisposition distinct from that of thyroid cancer.
30102696	A genome-wide association study identifies a susceptibility locus for biliary atresia on 2p16.1 within the gene EFEMP1.	Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare pediatric cholangiopathy characterized by fibrosclerosing obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventual liver failure. The etiology of BA remains unknown, although environmental, inflammatory, infectious, and genetic risk factors have been proposed. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a European-American cohort of 343 isolated BA patients and 1716 controls to identify genetic loci associated with BA. A second GWAS was performed in an independent European-American cohort of 156 patients with BA and other extrahepatic anomalies and 212 controls to confirm the identified candidate BA-associated SNPs. Meta-analysis revealed three genome-wide significant BA-associated SNPs on 2p16.1 (rs10865291, rs6761893, and rs727878; P < 5 ×10-8), located within the fifth intron of the EFEMP1 gene, which encodes a secreted extracellular protein implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell proliferation, and organogenesis. RNA expression analysis showed an increase in EFEMP1 transcripts from human liver specimens isolated from patients with either BA or other cholestatic diseases when compared to normal control liver samples. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that EFEMP1 is expressed in cholangiocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in liver specimens from patients with BA and other cholestatic diseases, but it is absent from cholangiocytes in normal control liver samples. Efemp1 transcripts had higher expression in cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts as compared with other cell types in normal rat liver. The identification of a novel BA-associated locus, and implication of EFEMP1 as a new BA candidate susceptibility gene, could provide new insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying this severe pediatric disorder.
30103242	Genome-Wide Association Study Links Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Sprouty 2 to Thrombocytopenia after Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery.	 Thrombocytopenia after cardiac surgery independently predicts stroke, acute kidney injury and death. To understand the underlying risks and mechanisms, we analysed genetic variations associated with thrombocytopenia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.  Study subjects underwent isolated on-pump CABG surgery at Duke University Medical Center. Post-operative thrombocytopenia was defined as platelet count < 100 × 10(9)/L. Using a logistic regression model adjusted for clinical risk factors, we performed a genome-wide association study in a discovery cohort ((n) = 860) and validated significant findings in a replication cohort ((n) = 296). Protein expression was assessed in isolated platelets by immunoblot.  A total of 63 single-nucleotide polymorphisms met a priori discovery thresholds for replication, but only 1 (rs9574547) in the intergenic region upstream of sprouty 2 ((SPRY2)) met nominal significance in the replication cohort. The minor allele of rs9574547 was associated with a lower risk for thrombocytopenia (discovery cohort, odds ratio, 0.45, 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.67,(p) = 9.76 × 10(-5)) with the overall association confirmed by meta-analysis (meta-(p) = 7.88 × 10(-6)). Immunoblotting demonstrated expression of SPRY2 and its dynamic regulation during platelet activation. Treatment with a functional SPRY2 peptide blunted platelet extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation after agonist stimulation.  We identified the association of a genetic polymorphism in the intergenic region of(SPRY2) with a decreased incidence of thrombocytopenia after CABG surgery. Because(SPRY2)-an endogenous receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor-is present in platelets and modulates essential signalling pathways, these findings support a role for(SPRY2) as a novel modulator of platelet responses after cardiac surgery.
30108155	Genome-wide association study identifies novel recessive genetic variants for high TGs in an Arab population.	Abnormal blood lipid levels are influenced by genetic and lifestyle/dietary factors. Although many genetic variants associated with blood lipid traits have been identified in Europeans, similar data in Middle Eastern populations are limited. We performed a genome-wide association study with Arab individuals (discovery cohort: 1,353; replication cohort: 1,176) from Kuwait to identify possible associations of genetic variants with high lipid levels. We used Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip and candidate SNP genotyping in the discovery and replication phases, respectively. For association tests, we used genetic models that were based on additive and recessive modes of inheritance. High triglycerides (TGs) were recessively associated with six risk variants (rs1002487/(RPS6KA1), rs11805972/(LAD1)) rs7761746/(Or5v1), rs39745/(CTTNBP2)-(LSM8), rs2934952/(PGAP3), and rs9626773/(RP11-191L9.4)-(CERK)) at genome-wide significance ((P)  6.12E-09), and another six variants (rs10873925/(ST6GALNAC5), rs4663379/(SPP2-ARL4C), rs10033119/(NPY1R), rs17709449/(LINC00911)-(FLRT2), rs11654954/(CDK12-NEUROD2), and rs9972882/(STARD3)) were associated at borderline significance ((P)  5.0E-08). High TG was also additively associated with rs11654954. All of the 12 identified markers are novel and are harbored in runs of homozygosity. Literature evidence supports the involvement of these gene loci in lipid-related processes. This study in an Arab population augments international efforts to identify genetic regulation of lipid traits.
30113228	Ancestry and genetic associations with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants is a common and often severe lung disease with long-term sequelae. A genetic component is suspected but not fully defined. We performed an ancestry and genome-wide association study to identify variants, genes, and pathways associated with survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia in 387 high-risk infants treated with inhaled nitric oxide in the Trial of Late Surfactant study. Global African genetic ancestry was associated with increased survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia among infants of maternal self-reported Hispanic white race/ethnicity [odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, P = 0.01]. Admixture mapping found suggestive outcome associations with local African ancestry at chromosome bands 18q21 and 10q22 among infants of maternal self-reported African-American race/ethnicity. For all infants, the top individual variant identified was within the intron of NBL1, which is expressed in midtrimester lung and is an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins ( rs372271081 , OR = 0.17, P = 7.4 × 10(-7)). The protective allele of this variant was significantly associated with lower nitric oxide metabolites in the urine of non-Hispanic white infants ( P = 0.006), supporting a role in the racial differential response to nitric oxide. Interrogating genes upregulated in bronchopulmonary dysplasia lungs indicated association with variants in CCL18, a cytokine associated with fibrosis and interstitial lung disease, and pathway analyses implicated variation in genes involved in immune/inflammatory processes in response to infection and mechanical ventilation. Our results suggest that genetic variation related to lung development, drug metabolism, and immune response contribute to individual and racial/ethnic differences in respiratory outcomes following inhaled nitric oxide treatment of high-risk premature infants.
30116032	Genetics of suicide attempts in individuals with and without mental disorders: a population-based genome-wide association study.	Family studies have shown an aggregation of suicidal behavior in families. Yet, molecular studies are needed to identify loci accounting for genetic heritability. We conducted a genome-wide association study and estimated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) heritability for a suicide attempt. In a case-cohort study, national data on all individuals born in Denmark after 1981 and diagnosed with severe mental disorders prior to 2013 (n = 57,377) and individuals from the general population (n = 30,000) were obtained. After quality control, the sample consisted of 6024 cases with an incidence of suicide attempt and 44,240 controls with no record of a suicide attempt. Suggestive associations between SNPs, rs6880062 (p-value: 5.4 × 10(-8)) and rs6880461 (p-value: 9.5 × 10(-8)), and suicide attempt were identified when adjusting for socio-demographics. Adjusting for mental disorders, three significant associations, all on chromosome 20, were identified: rs4809706 (p-value: 2.8 × 10(-8)), rs4810824 (p-value: 3.5 × 10(-8)), and rs6019297 (p-value: 4.7 × 10(8)). Sub-group analysis of cases with affective disorders revealed SNPs associated with suicide attempts when compared to the general population for gene PDE4B. All SNPs explained 4.6% [CI-95: 2.9-6.3%] of the variation in suicide attempt. Controlling for mental disorders reduced the heritability to 1.9% [CI-95: 0.3-3.5%]. Affective and autism spectrum disorders exhibited a SNP heritability of 5.6% [CI-95: 1.9-9.3%] and 9.6% [CI-95: 1.1-18.1%], respectively. Using the largest sample to date, we identified significant SNP associations with suicide attempts and support for a genetic transmission of suicide attempt, which might not solely be explained by mental disorders.
30120420	Identification of novel loci associated with infant cognitive ability.	It is believed that genetic factors play a large role in the development of many cognitive and neurological processes; however, epidemiological evidence for the genetic basis of childhood neurodevelopment is very limited. Identification of the genetic polymorphisms associated with early-stage neurodevelopment will help elucidate biological mechanisms involved in neuro-behavior and provide a better understanding of the developing brain. To search for such variants, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for infant mental and motor ability at two years of age with mothers and children recruited from cohorts in Bangladesh and Mexico. Infant ability was assessed using mental and motor composite scores calculated with country-specific versions of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. A missense variant (rs1055153) located in the gene WWTR1 reached genome-wide significance in association with mental composite score (meta-analysis effect size of minor allele β(meta) = -6.04; 95% CI: -8.13 to -3.94; P = 1.56×10(-8)). Infants carrying the minor allele reported substantially lower cognitive scores in both cohorts, and this variant is predicted to be in the top 0.3% of most deleterious substitutions in the human genome. Fine mapping and region-based association testing provided additional suggestive evidence that both WWTR1 and a second gene, LRP1B, were associated with infant cognitive ability. Comparisons with recently conducted GWAS in intelligence and educational attainment indicate that our phenotypes do not possess a high genetic correlation with either adolescent or adult cognitive traits, suggesting that infant neurological assessments should be treated as an independent outcome of interest. Additional functional studies and replication efforts in other cohorts may help uncover new biological pathways and genetic architectures that are crucial to the developing brain.
30130595	Pilot genome-wide association study identifying novel risk loci for type 2 diabetes in a Maya population.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is one of the two leading causes of mortality in Mexico. However, most studies have focused on Caucasians or Asians, and there are a small number of studies investigating Maya populations. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no information on isolated Maya communities with T2D frequencies of 20% that are primarily attributed to ethnicity. Consequently, this study focused on assessing which genetic risk variants could be involved in the high rates of T2D in 92 individuals with Maya ancestry; 47 were diagnosed with T2D, and 45 were classified as healthy individuals. A pilot genome-wide association study was performed using the Affymetrix Axiom Genome-wide LAT1 array. The population structure was determined with the ADMIXTURE software using 1289 Latin American selected polymorphisms, and 39 polymorphisms associated with T2D were included for replication. Association tests were performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) using the allelic, genotype and Armitage trend tests. The results indicated that population structure analysis displayed no differences between T2D patients and healthy individuals; 24 loci located were identified for probable association with T2D (p > 1.288 × 10(-7) and p < 1.348 × 10(-4)); the polymorphism AGTR2 rs1914711 in chromosome X was identified by the allele test (OR = 6.824; p = 1.448 × 10(-9)) as a candidate gene for association with T2D; and ARL15 rs4311394 was associated as a T2D protector by genotype and the Armitage trend test (OR = 0.318; p = 0.001). In conclusion, this study proposes 24 candidate SNPs associated with T2D for replication studies and one for protective association with T2D.
30294719	Sex Differences in Genetic Associations With Longevity.	Sex differences in genetic associations with human longevity remain largely unknown; investigations on this topic are important for individualized health care. To explore sex differences in genetic associations with longevity. This population-based case-control study used sex-specific genome-wide association study and polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to examine sex differences in genetic associations with longevity. Five hundred sixty-four male and 1614 female participants older than 100 years were compared with a control group of 773 male and 1526 female individuals aged 40 to 64 years. All were Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study participants with Han ethnicity who were recruited in 1998 and 2008 to 2014. Sex-specific loci and pathways associated with longevity and PRS measures of joint effects of sex-specific loci. Eleven male-specific and 11 female-specific longevity loci ((P) < 10(-5)) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific longevity loci (10(-5) ≤(P) < 10(-4)) were identified. Each of these loci's associations with longevity were replicated in north and south regions of China in one sex but were not significant in the other sex ((P) = .13-.97), and loci-sex interaction effects were significant ((P) < .05). The associations of loci rs60210535 of the(LINC00871) gene with longevity were replicated in Chinese women ((P) = 9.0 × 10(-5)) and US women ((P) = 4.6 × 10(-5)) but not significant in Chinese and US men. The associations of the loci rs2622624 of the(ABCG2) gene were replicated in Chinese women ((P) = 6.8 × 10(-5)) and European women ((P) = .003) but not significant in both Chinese and European men. Eleven male-specific pathways (inflammation and immunity genes) and 34 female-specific pathways (tryptophan metabolism and PGC-1α induced) were significantly associated with longevity ((P) < .005; false discovery rate < 0.05). The PRS analyses demonstrated that sex-specific associations with longevity of the 4 exclusive groups of 11 male-specific and 11 female-specific loci ((P) < 10(-5)) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific loci (10(-5) ≤(P) < 10(-4)) were jointly replicated across north and south discovery and target samples. Analyses using the combined data set of north and south showed that these 4 groups of sex-specific loci were jointly and significantly associated with longevity in one sex ((P) = 2.9 × 10(-70) to 1.3 × 10(-39)) but not jointly significant in the other sex ((P) = .11 to .70), while interaction effects between PRS and sex were significant ((P) = 4.8 × 10(-50) to 1.2 × 10(-16)). The sex differences in genetic associations with longevity are remarkable, but have been overlooked by previously published genome-wide association studies on longevity. This study contributes to filling this research gap and provides a scientific basis for further investigating effects of sex-specific genetic variants and their interactions with environment on healthy aging, which may substantially contribute to more effective and targeted individualized health care for male and female elderly individuals.
30152087	Age-specific genome-wide association study in glioblastoma identifies increased proportion of 'lower grade glioma'-like features associated with younger age.	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in the United States. Incidence of GBM increases with age, and younger age-at-diagnosis is significantly associated with improved prognosis. While the relationship between candidate GBM risk SNPs and age-at-diagnosis has been explored, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not previously been stratified by age. Potential age-specific genetic effects were assessed in autosomal SNPs for GBM patients using data from four previous GWAS. Using age distribution tertiles (18-53, 54-64, 65+) datasets were analyzed using age-stratified logistic regression to generate p values, odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), and then combined using meta-analysis. There were 4,512 total GBM cases, and 10,582 controls used for analysis. Significant associations were detected at two previously identified SNPs in 7p11.2 (rs723527 [p(54-63) = 1.50x10(-9) , OR(54-63) = 1.28, 95%CI(54-63) = 1.18-1.39; p(64+) = 2.14x10(-11) , OR(64+) = 1.32, 95%CI(64+) = 1.21-1.43] and rs11979158 [p(54-63) = 6.13x10(-8) , OR(54-63) = 1.35, 95%CI(54-63) = 1.21-1.50; p(64+) = 2.18x10(-10) , OR(64+) = 1.42, 95%CI(64+) = 1.27-1.58]) but only in persons >54. There was also a significant association at the previously identified lower grade glioma (LGG) risk locus at 8q24.21 (rs55705857) in persons ages 18-53 (p(18-53) = 9.30 × 10(-11) , OR(18-53) = 1.76, 95%CI(18-53) = 1.49-2.10). Within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) there was higher prevalence of 'LGG'-like tumor characteristics in GBM samples in those 18-53, with IDH1/2 mutation frequency of 15%, as compared to 2.1% [54-63] and 0.8% [64+] (p = 0.0005). Age-specific differences in cancer susceptibility can provide important clues to etiology. The association of a SNP known to confer risk for IDH1/2 mutant glioma and higher prevalence of IDH1/2 mutation within younger individuals 18-53 suggests that more younger individuals may present initially with 'secondary glioblastoma.'
30161160	A genome-wide association study identifies three novel genetic markers for response to tamoxifen: A prospective multicenter study.	Although association studies of genetic variations with the clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen have been reported, genetic factors which could determine individual response to tamoxifen are not fully clarified. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify novel genetic markers for response to tamoxifen. We prospectively collected 347 blood samples from patients with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, invasive breast cancer receiving preoperative tamoxifen monotherapy for 14 to 28 days. We used Ki-67 response in breast cancer tissues after preoperative short-term tamoxifen therapy as a surrogate marker for response to tamoxifen. We performed GWAS and genotype imputation using 275 patients, and an independent set of 72 patients was used for replication study. The combined result of GWAS and the replication study, and subsequent imputation analysis indicated possible association of three loci with Ki-67 response after tamoxifen therapy (rs17198973 on chromosome 4q34.3, rs4577773 on 6q12, and rs7087428 on 10p13, Pcombined = 5.69 x 10-6, 1.64 x 10-5, and 9.77 x 10-6, respectively). When patients were classified into three groups by the scoring system based on the genotypes of the three SNPs, patients with higher scores showed significantly higher after/before ratio of Ki-67 compared to those with lower scores (P = 1.8 x 10-12), suggesting the cumulative effect of the three SNPs. We identified three novel loci, which could be associated with clinical response to tamoxifen. These findings provide new insights into personalized hormonal therapy for the patients with breast cancer.
30160337	Genomewide association study reveals novel genetic loci associated with change in renal function in heart transplant recipients.	Renal dysfunction occurs commonly after heart transplantation (HTx) with wide inter-individual variability but whether a genetic predisposition exists in these patients is unknown. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have not been performed to assess the association of genetic variation with change in renal function after HTx. Clinical and demographic data of patients who underwent HTx and provided blood samples and consent for genetic analysis were included. Genotyping was performed using Illumina Infinium Human CoreExome v1.0 analysis kit. A GWAS utilizing linear regression models was performed with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1 year as the phenotype after adjusting for baseline eGFR prior to HTx and conversion from calcineurin inhibitor to sirolimus as primary immunosuppression therapy. A total of 251 HTx recipients were genotyped for 314,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The mean (SD) age was 50 (12.5) years; most patients were of European origin (n = 243, 96.8%) and males (n = 179, 71.3%). After adjustment for potential confounders, two variants, rs17033285 (P = 4.3 × 10(-7) ) and rs4917601 (P = 6.46 × 10(-7) ), in a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene LINC01121 and a pseudogene BTBD7P2, were identified to have a significant association with change in GFR at 1 year after HTx. Our first of its kind GWAS demonstrates that genetic variation affects renal function after HTx independent of other risk factors. Agnostic genetic approaches such as these may lead to identification of novel biological pathways such as the role of lncRNAs in the development of renal dysfunction post-HTx.
30169916	Investigation of the predisposing factor of pemphigus and its clinical subtype through a genome-wide association and next generation sequence analysis.	Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and foliaceus (PF) as the two major histological subtypes. Associations with HLA molecules have been suggested, but specific HLA risk variants as well as non-HLA risk variants remain to be discovered. We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study in the Chinese Han population through a genome-wide discovery analysis and follow-up validation analysis in a total number of 210 PV, 159 PF and 2493 healthy controls. HLA imputation as well as high coverage next generation sequencing based HLA genotyping was employed to investigate the association of classical HLA alleles and amino acid change. We have discovered independent novel associations with PF at rs2178077 on 12q24.33, located next to RAN (P(PF) = 1.57 × 10(-9) ) and rs3888722 within the MHC region (P = 6.73 × 10(-9) ). For the HLA variants, we confirmed independent genome-wide level risk associations in HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1, with DQB1*05:03 to be the strongest association with PV (P = 8.59 × 10(-68) , OR = 31.16) and PF (P = 4.84 × 10(-17) , OR = 5.64). In addition, DRB1*14 was demonstrated to be a second independent variants (P = 4.2 × 10(-63) , OR = 35.47) for PV, while DRB1*04:06 was demonstrated to be the second independent signal (P = 7.44 × 10(-13) , OR = 5.58) for PF. These findings advance our understanding of the genetic basis of pemphigus susceptibility and may offer opportunities for risk prediction and preventive treatment for pemphigus, in particular for PV.
30166627	Genome-wide association study of response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitor therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by chronic synovial joint inflammation. Treatment has been revolutionised by tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFi) but each available drug shows a significant non-response rate. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 1752 UK RA TNFi-treated patients to identify predictors of change in the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) and subcomponents over 3-6 months. The rs7195994 variant at the FTO gene locus was associated with infliximab response when looking at a change in the swollen joint count (SJC28) subcomponent (p = 9.74 × 10(-9)). Capture Hi-C data show chromatin interactions in GM12878 cells between rs2540767, in high linkage disequilibrium with rs7195994 (R(2) = 0.9) and IRX3, a neighbouring gene of FTO. IRX3 encodes a transcription factor involved in adipocyte remodelling and is regarded as the obesity gene at the FTO locus. Importantly, the rs7195994 association remained significantly associated following adjustment for BMI. In addition, using capture Hi-C data we showed interactions between TNFi-response associated variants and 16 RA susceptibility variants.
30178632	A genome-wide association study suggests new evidence for an association of the NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4) gene with severe diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes.	Diabetic retinopathy is the most common eye complication in patients with diabetes. The purpose of this study is to identify genetic factors contributing to severe diabetic retinopathy. A genome-wide association approach was applied. In the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS) datasets, cases of severe diabetic retinopathy were defined as type 2 diabetic patients who were ever graded as having severe background retinopathy (Level R3) or proliferative retinopathy (Level R4) in at least one eye according to the Scottish Diabetic Retinopathy Grading Scheme or who were once treated by laser photocoagulation. Controls were diabetic individuals whose longitudinal retinopathy screening records were either normal (Level R0) or only with mild background retinopathy (Level R1) in both eyes. Significant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were taken forward for meta-analysis using multiple Caucasian cohorts. Five hundred and sixty cases of type 2 diabetes with severe diabetic retinopathy and 4,106 controls were identified in the GoDARTS cohort. We revealed that rs3913535 in the NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4) gene reached a p value of 4.05 × 10(-9) . Two nearby SNPs, rs10765219 and rs11018670 also showed promising p values (p values = 7.41 × 10(-8) and 1.23 × 10(-8) , respectively). In the meta-analysis using multiple Caucasian cohorts (excluding GoDARTS), rs10765219 and rs11018670 showed associations for diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively), while the p value of rs3913535 was not significant (p = 0.429). This genome-wide association study of severe diabetic retinopathy suggests new evidence for the involvement of the NOX4 gene.
30194254	Genome-wide association study implicates immune dysfunction in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma.	To further our understanding of inherited susceptibility to Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), we performed a meta-analysis of 7 genome-wide association studies totaling 5325 HL cases and 22 423 control patients. We identify 5 new HL risk loci at 6p21.31 (rs649775;(P) = 2.11 × 10(-10)), 6q23.3 (rs1002658;(P) = 2.97 × 10(-8)), 11q23.1 (rs7111520;(P) = 1.44 × 10(-11)), 16p11.2 (rs6565176;(P) = 4.00 × 10(-8)), and 20q13.12 (rs2425752;(P) = 2.01 × 10(-8)). Integration of gene expression, histone modification, and in situ promoter capture Hi-C data at the 5 new and 13 known risk loci implicates dysfunction of the germinal center reaction, disrupted T-cell differentiation and function, and constitutive NF-κB activation as mechanisms of predisposition. These data provide further insights into the genetic susceptibility and biology of HL.
30219690	GWAS and systems biology analysis of depressive symptoms among smokers from the COPDGene cohort.	Large sample GWAS is needed to identify genetic factors associated with depression. This study used genome-wide genotypic and phenotypic data from the COPDGene study to identify genetic risk factors for depression. Data were from 9716 COPDGene subjects with ≥10 pack-year history. Depression was defined as antidepressant use and/or a HADS depression subscale score ≥8. Non-Hispanic White (6576) and African-American (3140) subsets were analyzed. A GWAS pipeline identified SNPs associated with depression in each group. Network analysis software analyzed gene interactions through common biological pathways, genetic interactions, and tissue-specific gene expression. The mean age was 59.4 years (SD 9.0) with 46.5% female subjects. Depression was in 24.7% of the NHW group (1622) and 12.5% of the AA group (391). No SNPs had genome-wide significance. One of the top SNPs, rs12036147 (p = 1.28 × 10(-6)), is near CHRM3. Another SNP was near MDGA2 (rs17118176, p = 3.52 × 10(-6)). Top genes formed networks for synaptic transmission with a statistically significant level of more co-expression in brain than other tissues, particularly in the basal ganglia (p = 1.00 × 10(-4)). Limitations included a depression definition based on antidepressant use and a limited HADS score subgroup, which could increase false negatives in depressed patients not on antidepressants. Antidepressants used for smoking cessation in non-depressed patients could lead to false positives. Systems biology analysis identified statistically significant pathways whereby multiple genes influence depression. The gene set pathway analysis and COPDGene data can help investigate depression in future studies.
30201983	NT5C2 germline variants alter thiopurine metabolism and are associated with acquired NT5C2 relapse mutations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.	The antileukaemic drug 6-mercaptopurine is converted into thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) and incorporated into DNA (DNA-TG), the active end metabolite. In a series of genome-wide association studies, we analysed time-weighted means ((wm)) of erythrocyte concentrations of TGN (Ery-TGN) and DNA-TG in 1009 patients undergoing maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In discovery analyses (454 patients), the propensity for DNA-TG incorporation ((wm)DNA-TG/(wm)Ery-TGN ratio) was significantly associated with three intronic SNPs in NT5C2 (top hit: rs72846714; P = 2.09 × 10(-10), minor allele frequency 15%). In validation analyses (555 patients), this association remained significant during both early and late maintenance therapy (P = 8.4 × 10(-6) and 1.3 × 10(-3), respectively). The association was mostly driven by differences in(wm)Ery-TGN, but in regression analyses adjusted for(wm)Ery-TGN (P < 0.0001), rs72846714-A genotype was also associated with a higher(wm)DNA-TG (P = 0.029). Targeted sequencing of NT5C2 did not identify any missense variants associated with rs72846714 or(wm)Ery-TGN/(wm)DNA-TG. rs72846714 was not associated with relapse risk, but in a separate cohort of 180 children with relapsed ALL, rs72846714-A genotype was associated with increased occurrence of relapse-specific NT5C2 gain-of-function mutations that reduce cytosol TGN levels (P = 0.03). These observations highlight the impact of both germline and acquired mutations in drug metabolism and disease trajectory.
30206230	GWAS for Interleukin-1β levels in gingival crevicular fluid identifies IL37 variants in periodontal inflammation.	There is no agnostic GWAS evidence for the genetic control of IL-1β expression in periodontal disease. Here we report a GWAS for "high" gingival crevicular fluid IL-1β expression among 4910 European-American adults and identify association signals in the IL37 locus. rs3811046 at this locus (p = 3.3 × 10(-22)) is associated with severe chronic periodontitis (OR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.12-2.00), 10-year incident tooth loss (≥3 teeth: RR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.09-1.62) and aggressive periodontitis (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.01-1.26) in an independent sample of 4927 German/Dutch adults. The minor allele at rs3811046 is associated with increased expression of IL-1β in periodontal tissue. In RAW macrophages, PBMCs and transgenic mice, the IL37 variant increases expression of IL-1β and IL-6, inducing more severe periodontal disease, while IL-37 protein production is impaired and shows reduced cleavage by caspase-1. A second variant in the IL37 locus (rs2708943, p = 4.2 × 10(-7)) associates with attenuated IL37 mRNA expression. Overall, we demonstrate that IL37 variants modulate the inflammatory cascade in periodontal disease.
30277614	Genome-wide interaction studies identify sex-specific risk alleles for nonsyndromic orofacial clefts.	Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is the most common craniofacial birth defect in humans and is notable for its apparent sexual dimorphism where approximately twice as many males are affected as females. The sources of this disparity are largely unknown, but interactions between genetic and sex effects are likely contributors. We examined gene-by-sex (G × S) interactions in a worldwide sample of 2,142 NSCL/P cases and 1,700 controls recruited from 13 countries. First, we performed genome-wide joint tests of the genetic (G) and G × S effects genome-wide using logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model and adjusting for 18 principal components of ancestry. We further interrogated loci with suggestive results from the joint test ( p < 1.00 × 10(-5) ) by examining the G × S effects from the same model. Out of the 133 loci with suggestive results ( p < 1.00 × 10(-5) ) for the joint test, we observed one genome-wide significant G × S effect in the 10q21 locus (rs72804706; p = 6.69 × 10(-9) ; OR = 2.62 CI [1.89, 3.62]) and 16 suggestive G × S effects. At the intergenic 10q21 locus, the risk of NSCL/P is estimated to increase with additional copies of the minor allele for females, but the opposite effect for males. Our observation that the impact of genetic variants on NSCL/P risk differs for males and females may further our understanding of the genetic architecture of NSCL/P and the sex differences underlying clefts and other birth defects.
30277654	Gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase genetic polymorphism is a candidate locus for responsiveness to opioid analgesics in patients with cancer pain: An exploratory study.	Cancer pain impairs not only physical functions but also social functions and roles. Consequently, the overall health-related quality of life of patients with cancer pain deteriorates. Opioid analgesics are recommended for treating moderate to strong cancer pain. Advances in human genome research have fueled a growing interest to understand individual differences in responsiveness to opioid analgesics. This study aimed to explore and identify novel loci for genes predisposing an individual to opioid analgesic responsiveness. A total of 71 cancer patients rated their pain on an 11-point numerical rating scale twice before and after increasing opioid analgesics. A genomewide association study focusing on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted to associate pain decrease with increased dosage of opioid analgesics based on weight (ie, responsiveness to opioid analgesics). A genomewide significance (P < 5E-8) was set for multiplicity of analyses to control for false positives. Two SNPs passed the genomewide threshold for significance. One exonic SNP (rs1641025) was located in the ABAT [4-aminobutyrate aminotransaminase (GABA transaminase)] gene on chromosome 16. The other SNP (rs12494691) was located on chromosome 3, which was not associated with any known genes. These SNPs were not associated with opioid-related adverse effects. Our results preliminarily suggest that both SNPs might be potential candidate loci for responsiveness to opioid analgesics, and GABA transaminase might be a possible target for developing adjuvant pharmacotherapy with opioid analgesics in adjuvant pharmacotherapy. Our results should be validated in a large-scale study with a larger sample size.
30217807	Genetic Variants Associated with Circulating Fibroblast Growth Factor 23.	Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived hormone that regulates phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism, contributes to the pathogenesis of mineral and bone disorders in CKD and is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor. Central elements of FGF23 regulation remain incompletely understood; genetic variation may help explain interindividual differences. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of circulating FGF23 concentrations among 16,624 participants of European ancestry from seven cohort studies, excluding participants with eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) to focus on FGF23 under normal conditions. We evaluated the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with natural log-transformed FGF23 concentration, adjusted for age, sex, study site, and principal components of ancestry. A second model additionally adjusted for BMI and eGFR. We discovered 154 SNPs from five independent regions associated with FGF23 concentration. The SNP with the strongest association, rs17216707 ((P)=3.0×10(-24)), lies upstream of(CYP24A1), which encodes the primary catabolic enzyme for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Each additional copy of the T allele at this locus is associated with 5% higher FGF23 concentration. Another locus strongly associated with variations in FGF23 concentration is rs11741640, within(RGS14) and upstream of(SLC34A1) (a gene involved in renal phosphate transport). Additional adjustment for BMI and eGFR did not materially alter the magnitude of these associations. Another top locus (within(ABO), the ABO blood group transferase gene) was no longer statistically significant at the genome-wide level. Common genetic variants located near genes involved in vitamin D metabolism and renal phosphate transport are associated with differences in circulating FGF23 concentrations.
30217971	Genome-wide association study of seasonal affective disorder.	Family and twin studies have shown a genetic component to seasonal affective disorder (SAD). A number of candidate gene studies have examined the role of variations within biologically relevant genes in SAD susceptibility, but few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to date. The authors aimed to identify genetic risk variants for SAD through GWAS. The authors performed a GWAS for SAD in 1380 cases and 2937 controls of European-American (EA) origin, selected from samples for GWAS of major depressive disorder and of bipolar disorder. Further bioinformatic analyses were conducted to examine additional genomic and biological evidence associated with the top GWAS signals. No susceptibility loci for SAD were identified at a genome-wide significant level. The strongest association was at an intronic variant (rs139459337) within ZBTB20 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.63, p = 8.4 × 10(-7)), which encodes a transcriptional repressor that has roles in neurogenesis and in adult brain. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis showed that the risk allele "T" of rs139459337 is associated with reduced mRNA expression of ZBTB20 in human temporal cortex (p = 0.028). Zbtb20 is required for normal murine circadian rhythm and for entrainment to a shortened day. Of the 330 human orthologs of murine genes directly repressed by Zbtb20, there were 32 associated with SAD in our sample (at p < 0.05), representing a significant enrichment of ZBTB20 targets among our SAD genetic association signals (fold = 1.93, p = 0.001). ZBTB20 is a candidate susceptibility gene for SAD, based on a convergence of genetic, genomic, and biological evidence. Further studies are necessary to confirm its role in SAD.
30218097	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of aggressive and chronic periodontitis identifies two novel risk loci.	Periodontitis is one of the most common inflammatory diseases, with a prevalence of 11% worldwide for the severe forms and an estimated heritability of 50%. It is classified into the widespread moderate form chronic periodontitis (CP) and the rare early-onset and severe phenotype aggressive periodontitis (AgP). These different disease manifestations are thought to share risk alleles and predisposing environmental factors. To obtain novel insights into the shared genetic etiology and the underlying molecular mechanisms of both forms, we performed a two step-wise meta-analysis approach using genome-wide association studies of both phenotypes. Genotypes from imputed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AgP and CP comprising 5,095 cases and 9,908 controls of North-West European genetic background were included. Two loci were associated with periodontitis at a genome-wide significance level. They located within the pseudogene MTND1P5 on chromosome 8 (rs16870060-G, P = 3.69 × 10(-9), OR = 1.36, 95% CI = [1.23-1.51]) and intronic of the long intergenic non-coding RNA LOC107984137 on chromosome 16, downstream of the gene SHISA9 (rs729876-T, P = 9.77 × 10(-9), OR = 1.24, 95% CI = [1.15-1.34]). This study identified novel risk loci of periodontitis, adding to the genetic basis of AgP and CP.
30255771	Investigation of parent-of-origin effects induced by fenofibrate treatment on triglycerides levels.	Genome-wide association studies performed on triglycerides (TGs) have not accounted for epigenetic mechanisms that may partially explain trait heritability. Parent-of-origin (POO) effect association analyses using an agnostic approach or a candidate approach were performed for pretreatment TG levels, posttreatment TG levels, and pre- and posttreatment TG-level differences in the real GAW20 family data set. We detected 22 genetic variants with suggestive POO effects with at least 1 phenotype (P ≤ 10(- 5)). We evaluated the association of these 22 significant genetic variants showing POO effects with close DNA methylation probes associated with TGs. A total of 18 DNA methylation probes located in the vicinity of the 22 SNPs were associated with at least 1 phenotype and 6 SNP-probe pairs were associated with DNA methylation probes at the nominal level of P < 0.05, among which 1 pair presented evidence of POO effect. Our analyses identified a paternal effect of SNP rs301621 on the difference between pre- and posttreatment TG levels (P = 1.2 × 10(- 5)). This same SNP showed evidence for a maternal effect on methylation levels of a nearby probe (cg10206250; P = 0.01). Using a causal inference test we established that the observed POO effect of rs301621 was not mediated by DNA methylation at cg10206250. We performed POO effect association analyses of SNPs with TGs, as well as association analyses of SNPs with DNA methylation probes. These analyses, which were followed by a causal inference test, established that the paternal effect at the SNP rs301621 is induced by treatment and is not mediated by methylation level at cg10206250.
30228239	Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Genetic Link between Diarrhea-Associated Entamoeba histolytica Infection and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.	(Entamoeba histolytica) is the etiologic agent of amebic dysentery, though clinical manifestation of infection is highly variable ranging from subclinical colonization to invasive disease. We hypothesize that host genetics contribute to the variable outcomes of(E. histolytica) infection; thus, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two independent birth cohorts of Bangladeshi infants monitored for susceptibility to(E. histolytica) disease in the first year of life. Children with at least one diarrheal episode positive for(E. histolytica) (cases) were compared to children with no detectable(E. histolytica) infection in the same time frame (controls). Meta-analyses under a fixed-effect inverse variance weighting model identified multiple variants in a region of chromosome 10 containing loci associated with symptomatic(E. histolytica) infection. An intergenic insertion between(CREM) and(CCNY) (rs58000832) achieved genome-wide significance ((P) value from meta-analysis [(P)(meta)] = 6.05 × 10(-9)), and each additional risk allele of rs58000832 conferred 2.42 increased odds of a diarrhea-associated(E. histolytica) infection. The most strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within a gene was in an intron of(CREM) (rs58468612;(P)(meta) = 8.94 × 10(-8)), which has been implicated as a susceptibility locus for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Gene expression resources suggest associated loci are related to the lower expression of(CREM) Increased(CREM) expression is also observed in early(E. histolytica) infection. Further,CREM mice were more susceptible to(E. histolytica) amebic colitis. These genetic associations reinforce the pathological similarities observed in gut inflammation between(E. histolytica) infection and IBD.(IMPORTANCE) Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death for children globally, causing 760,000 deaths each year in children less than 5 years old. Amebic dysentery contributes significantly to this burden, especially in developing countries. The identification of host factors that control or enable enteric pathogens has the potential to transform our understanding of disease predisposition, outcomes, and treatments. Our discovery of the transcriptional regulator cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) as a genetic modifier of susceptibility to amebic disease has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of other diarrheal infections. Further, emerging evidence for CREM in IBD susceptibility suggests that CREM is a critical regulator of enteric inflammation and may have broad therapeutic potential as a drug target across intestinal inflammatory diseases.
30237584	Genome-wide association analysis of common genetic variants of resistant hypertension.	Resistant hypertension (RHTN), defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140/90 using three or more drugs or controlled BP (<140/90) using four or more drugs, is associated with adverse outcomes, including decline in kidney function. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis in 1194 White and Hispanic participants with hypertension and coronary artery disease from the INternational VErapamil-SR Trandolapril STudy-GENEtic Substudy (INVEST-GENES). Top variants associated with RHTN at p < 10(-4) were tested for replication in 585 White and Hispanic participants with hypertension and subcortical strokes from the Secondary Prevention of Subcortical Strokes GENEtic Substudy (SPS3-GENES). A genetic risk score for RHTN was created by summing the risk alleles of replicated RHTN signals. rs11749255 in MSX2 was associated with RHTN in INVEST (odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) = 1.50 (1.2-1.8), p = 7.3 × 10(-5)) and replicated in SPS3 (OR = 2.0 (1.4-2.8), p = 4.3 × 10(-5)), with genome-wide significance in meta-analysis (OR = 1.60 (1.3-1.9), p = 3.8 × 10(-8)). Other replicated signals were in IFLTD1 and PTPRD. IFLTD1 rs6487504 was associated with RHTN in INVEST (OR = 1.90 (1.4-2.5), p = 1.1 × 10(-)(5)) and SPS3 (OR = 1.70 (1.2-2.5), p = 4 × 10(-3)). PTPRD rs324498, a previously reported RHTN signal, was among the top signals in INVEST (OR = 1.60 (1.3-2.0), p = 3.4 × 10(-)(5)) and replicated in SPS3 (OR = 1.60 (1.1-2.4), one-sided p = 0.005). Participants with the highest number of risk alleles were at increased risk of RHTN compared to participants with a lower number (p-trend = 1.8 × 10(-15)). Overall, we identified and replicated associations with RHTN in the MSX2, IFLTD1, and PTPRD regions, and combined these associations to create a genetic risk score.
30247649	Analysis of the genetic component of systemic sclerosis in Iranian and Turkish populations through a genome-wide association study.	SSc is an autoimmune disease characterized by alteration of the immune response, vasculopathy and fibrosis. Most genetic studies on SSc have been performed in European-ancestry populations. The aim of this study was to analyse the genetic component of SSc in Middle Eastern patients from Iran and Turkey through a genome-wide association study. This study analysed data from a total of 834 patients diagnosed with SSc and 1455 healthy controls from Iran and Turkey. DNA was genotyped using high-throughput genotyping platforms. The data generated were imputed using the Michigan Imputation Server, and the Haplotype Reference Consortium as a reference panel. A meta-analysis combining both case-control sets was conducted by the inverse variance method. The highest peak of association belonged to the HLA region in both the Iranian and Turkish populations. Strong and independent associations between the classical alleles HLA-DRB1*11: 04 [P = 2.10 × 10-24, odds ratio (OR) = 3.14] and DPB1*13: 01 (P = 5.37 × 10-14, OR = 5.75) and SSc were observed in the Iranian population. HLA-DRB1*11: 04 (P = 4.90 × 10-11, OR = 2.93) was the only independent signal associated in the Turkish cohort. An omnibus test yielded HLA-DRB1 58 and HLA-DPB1 76 as relevant amino acid positions for this disease. Concerning the meta-analysis, we also identified two associations close to the genome-wide significance level outside the HLA region, corresponding to IRF5-TNPO3 rs17424921-C (P = 1.34 × 10-7, OR = 1.68) and NFKB1 rs4648133-C (P = 3.11 × 10-7, OR = 1.47). We identified significant associations in the HLA region and suggestive associations in IRF5-TNPO3 and NFKB1 loci in Iranian and Turkish patients affected by SSc through a genome-wide association study and an extensive HLA analysis.
30242241	Genome-wide analysis of polymorphism × sodium interaction effect on blood pressure identifies a novel 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus.	Excessive sodium intake is a global risk factor for hypertension. Sodium effects on blood pressure vary from person to person; hence, high-risk group targeting based on personal genetic information can play a complementary role to ongoing population preventive approaches to reduce sodium consumption. To identify genetic factors that modulate sodium effects on blood pressure, we conducted a population-based genome-wide interaction analysis in 8,768 Japanese subjects, which was >3 times larger than a similar previous study. We tested 7,135,436 polymorphisms in the discovery cohort, and loci that met suggestive significance were further examined in an independent replication cohort. We found that an interaction between a novel 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus and daily sodium consumption was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure in both discovery and replication cohorts under the recessive model. Further statistical analysis of rs8022678, the sentinel variant of the 3'-BCL11B gene desert locus, showed that differences in mean systolic blood pressure between high and low sodium consumption subgroups were 5.9 mm Hg (P = 8.8 × 10(-12)) in rs8022678 A carriers and -0.3 mm Hg (P = 0.27) in rs8022678 A non-carriers, suggesting that the rs8022678 genotype can classify persons into sodium-sensitive (A carriers) and sodium-insensitive (A non-carriers) subgroups. Our results implied that rs8022678 A carriers may receive a greater benefit from sodium-lowering interventions than non-carriers.
30251476	Identification of a 3'-Untranslated Genetic Variant of RARB Associated With Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Genome-Wide Association Study.	To investigate the genetic background influencing the development of cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which, after quality control and imputation, a total of 6,308,944 polymorphisms across the whole genome were analyzed in 2,989 RA patients of European origin. Data on subclinical atherosclerosis, obtained through assessment of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and presence/absence of carotid plaques by carotid ultrasonography, were available for 1,355 individuals. A genetic variant of the RARB gene (rs116199914) was associated with CIMT values at the genome-wide level of significance (minor allele [G] β coefficient 0.142, P = 1.86 × 10(-8) ). Interestingly, rs116199914 overlapped with regulatory elements in tissues related to CV pathophysiology and immune cells. In addition, biologic pathway enrichment and predictive protein-protein relationship analyses, including suggestive GWAS signals of potential relevance, revealed a functional enrichment of the collagen biosynthesis network related to the presence/absence of carotid plaques (Gene Ontology no. 0032964; false discovery rate-adjusted P = 4.01 × 10(-3) ). Furthermore, our data suggest potential influences of the previously described candidate CV risk loci NFKB1, MSRA, and ZC3HC1 (P = 8.12 × 10(-4) , P = 5.94 × 10(-4) , and P = 2.46 × 10(-4) , respectively). The present findings strongly suggest that genetic variation within RARB contributes to the development of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with RA.
30248107	Genome-wide association studies and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing identify regulatory variants influencing eyebrow thickness in humans.	Hair plays an important role in primates and is clearly subject to adaptive selection. While humans have lost most facial hair, eyebrows are a notable exception. Eyebrow thickness is heritable and widely believed to be subject to sexual selection. Nevertheless, few genomic studies have explored its genetic basis. Here, we performed a genome-wide scan for eyebrow thickness in 2961 Han Chinese. We identified two new loci of genome-wide significance, at 3q26.33 near SOX2 (rs1345417: P = 6.51×10(-10)) and at 5q13.2 near FOXD1 (rs12651896: P = 1.73×10(-8)). We further replicated our findings in the Uyghurs, a population from China characterized by East Asian-European admixture (N = 721), the CANDELA cohort from five Latin American countries (N = 2301), and the Rotterdam Study cohort of Dutch Europeans (N = 4411). A meta-analysis combining the full GWAS results from the three cohorts of full or partial Asian descent (Han Chinese, Uyghur and Latin Americans, N = 5983) highlighted a third signal of genome-wide significance at 2q12.3 (rs1866188: P = 5.81×10(-11)) near EDAR. We performed fine-mapping and prioritized four variants for further experimental verification. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing provided evidence that rs1345417 and rs12651896 affect the transcriptional activity of the nearby SOX2 and FOXD1 genes, which are both involved in hair development. Finally, suitable statistical analyses revealed that none of the associated variants showed clear signals of selection in any of the populations tested. Contrary to popular speculation, we found no evidence that eyebrow thickness is subject to strong selective pressure.
30265060	Genetic influences on delayed reward discounting: A genome-wide prioritized subset approach.	Delayed reward discounting (DRD) is a behavioral economic measure of impulsivity that has been consistently associated with addiction. It has also been identified as a promising addiction endophenotype, linking specific sources of genetic variation to individual risk. A challenge in the studies to date is that levels of DRD are often confounded with prior drug use, and previous studies have also had limited genomic scope. The current investigation sought to address these issues by studying DRD in healthy young adults with low levels of substance use (N = 986; 62% female, 100% European ancestry) and investigating genetic variation genome-wide. The genome-wide approach used a prioritized subset design, organizing the tests into theoretically and empirically informed categories and apportioning power accordingly. Three subsets were used: (a) a priori loci implicated by previous studies; (b) high-value addiction (HVA) markers from the recently developed SmokeScreen array; and (c) an atheoretical genome-wide scan. Among a priori loci, a nominally significant association was present between DRD and rs521674 in ADRA2A. No significant HVA loci were detected. One statistically significant genome-wide association was detected (rs13395777, p = 2.8 × 10-8), albeit in an intergenic region of unknown function. These findings are generally not supportive of the previous candidate gene studies and suggest that DRD has a complex genetic architecture that will require considerably larger samples to identify genetic associations more definitively.

30261039	Genome-wide meta-analysis of 158,000 individuals of European ancestry identifies three loci associated with chronic back pain.	Back pain is the #1 cause of years lived with disability worldwide, yet surprisingly little is known regarding the biology underlying this symptom. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of chronic back pain (CBP). Adults of European ancestry were included from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and from the UK Biobank interim data release. CBP cases were defined as those reporting back pain present for ≥3-6 months; non-cases were included as comparisons ("controls"). Each cohort conducted genotyping using commercially available arrays followed by imputation. GWAS used logistic regression models with additive genetic effects, adjusting for age, sex, study-specific covariates, and population substructure. The threshold for genome-wide significance in the fixed-effect inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was p<5×10(-8). Suggestive (p<5×10(-7)) and genome-wide significant (p<5×10(-8)) variants were carried forward for replication or further investigation in the remaining UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample. The discovery sample comprised 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 CBP cases. A genome-wide significant association was found for the intronic variant rs12310519 in SOX5 (OR 1.08, p = 7.2×10(-10)). This was subsequently replicated in 283,752 UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample, including 50,915 cases (OR 1.06, p = 5.3×10(-11)), and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis (OR 1.07, p = 4.5×10(-19)). We found suggestive associations at three other loci in the discovery sample, two of which exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant, rs7833174, located between CCDC26 and GSDMC (OR 1.05, p = 4.4×10(-13)), and an intronic variant, rs4384683, in DCC (OR 0.97, p = 2.4×10(-10)). In this first reported meta-analysis of GWAS for CBP, we identified and replicated a genetic locus associated with CBP (SOX5). We also identified 2 other loci that reached genome-wide significance in a 2-stage joint meta-analysis (CCDC26/GSDMC and DCC).
30266756	Common variants at 5q33.1 predispose to migraine in African-American children.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple susceptibility loci for migraine in European adults. However, no large-scale genetic studies have been performed in children or African Americans with migraine. We conducted a GWAS of 380 African-American children and 2129 ancestry-matched controls to identify variants associated with migraine. We then attempted to replicate our primary analysis in an independent cohort of 233 African-American patients and 4038 non-migraine control subjects. The results of this study indicate that common variants at 5q33.1 associated with migraine risk in African-American children (rs72793414, p=1.94×10(-9)). The association was validated in an independent study (p=3.87×10(-3)) for an overall meta-analysis p value of 3.81×10(-10). eQTL (Expression quantitative trait loci) analysis of the Genotype-Tissue Expression data also shows the genotypes of rs72793414 were strongly correlated with the mRNA expression levels of(NMUR2) at 5q33.1.(NMUR2) encodes a G protein-coupled receptor of neuromedin-U (NMU). NMU, a highly conserved neuropeptide, participates in diverse physiological processes of the central nervous system. This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of childhood migraine and allow for precision therapeutic development strategies targeting migraine patients of African-American ancestry.
30267110	Identification of the TIFAB Gene as a Susceptibility Locus for Coronary Artery Aneurysm in Patients with Kawasaki Disease.	Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limiting systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. KD is often complicated by coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs), which develop in about 20-25% of untreated children and 3-5% of children treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. To identify the risk loci for CAA susceptibility in patients with KD, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using our previous Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 KD patients) and a new replication study in an independent sample set (713 KD patients) by grouping KD patients without CAA (control) versus KD patients with extremely large aneurysms (diameter ≥ 5 mm) (case). Among 44 candidate single -nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from the initial GWAS data (33 cases vs. 215 controls), a SNP (rs899162) located 7 kb upstream of the TIFAB gene on chromosome five was replicated in an independent sample (12 cases vs. 532 controls). In the combined analysis (45 cases vs. 747 controls), the SNP (rs899162) showed a highly significant association with CAA formation (diameter ≥ 5 mm) in patients with KD (odds ratio = 3.20, 95% confidence interval = 2.02-5.05, P(combined) = 1.95 × 10(-7)). These results indicate that the TIFAB gene may act as a CAA susceptibility locus in patients with KD.
30266950	A variant at 9q34.11 is associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02 negative essential hypersomnia.	Essential hypersomnia (EHS) is a lifelong disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness without cataplexy. EHS is associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*06:02, similar to narcolepsy with cataplexy (narcolepsy). Previous studies suggest that DQB1*06:02-positive and -negative EHS are different in terms of their clinical features and follow different pathological pathways. DQB1*06:02-positive EHS and narcolepsy share the same susceptibility genes. In the present study, we report a genome-wide association study with replication for DQB1*06:02-negative EHS (408 patients and 2247 healthy controls, all Japanese). One single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs10988217, which is located 15-kb upstream of carnitine O-acetyltransferase (CRAT), was significantly associated with DQB1*06:02-negative EHS (P = 7.5 × 10(-9), odds ratio = 2.63). The risk allele of the disease-associated SNP was correlated with higher expression levels of CRAT in various tissues and cell types, including brain tissue. In addition, the risk allele was associated with levels of succinylcarnitine (P = 1.4 × 10(-18)) in human blood. The leading SNP in this region was the same in associations with both DQB1*06:02-negative EHS and succinylcarnitine levels. The results suggest that DQB1*06:02-negative EHS may be associated with an underlying dysfunction in energy metabolic pathways.
30305239	Genetic contributors to serum uric acid levels in Mexicans and their effect on premature coronary artery disease.	Serum uric acid (SUA) is a heritable trait associated with cardiovascular risk factors and coronary artery disease (CAD). Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genes associated with SUA, mainly in European populations. However, to date there are few GWAS in Latino populations, and the role of SUA-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cardiovascular disease has not been studied in the Mexican population. We performed genome-wide SUA association study in 2153 Mexican children and adults, evaluated whether genetic effects were modified by sex and obesity, and used a Mendelian randomization approach in an independent cohort to study the role of SUA modifying genetic variants in premature CAD. Only two loci were associated with SUA levels: SLC2A9 (β = -0.47 mg/dl, P = 1.57 × 10(-42) for lead SNP rs7678287) and ABCG2 (β = 0.23 mg/dl, P = 2.42 × 10(-10) for lead SNP rs2231142). No significant interaction between SLC2A9 rs7678287 and ABCG2 rs2231142 genotypes and obesity was observed. However, a significant ABCG2 rs2231142 genotype*sex interaction (P = 0.001) was observed in adults but not in children. Although SUA levels were associated with premature CAD, metabolic syndrome and decreased glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), only ABCG2 rs2231142 was associated with decreased eGFR in the premature CAD group. SUA elevation was independently associated with premature CAD, metabolic syndrome and decreased eGFR in the Mexican population. However, a Mendelian randomization approach using the lead SUA-associated SNPs (SLC2A9 and ABCG2) did not support a causal role of elevated SUA levels for premature CAD.
30357299	Association of Genetic Variants With Warfarin-Associated Bleeding Among Patients of African Descent.	Major warfarin-related bleeding occurs more frequently in African Americans than in other populations. Identification of potential genetic factors related to this adverse event may help identify at-risk patients. To identify genetic factors associated with warfarin-related bleeding in patients of African descent at an international normalized ratio (INR) of less than 4. A case-control genome-wide association study involving patients of African descent taking warfarin was conducted in a discovery cohort (University of Chicago [2009-2011] and the University of Illinois at Chicago [2002-2011]), and associations were confirmed in a replication cohort (University of Chicago [2015-2016]). Potential population stratification was examined in the discovery cohort by principal component analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were computed for bleeding risk by logistic regression analysis. Summary statistics from the discovery and the replication cohorts were analyzed with a fixed effects meta-analysis. The potential influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene expression was studied by luciferase expression assays. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with warfarin-related bleeding. Major bleeding-defined as bleeding requiring hospitalization, causing a decrease in hemoglobin level of more than 2 g/dL, requiring blood transfusion, or any combination of the 3-while taking warfarin at an INR of less than 4. The discovery cohort consisted of 31 cases (mean age, 60.1 years [SD, 14.9 years], 26 women [83.9%]) and 184 warfarin-treated controls (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 15.7 years]) with no documented bleeding. The replication cohort consisted of 40 cases (mean age, 55.6 years [SD, 17.3 years], 27 women [67.5%]), and 148 warfarin-treated controls (mean age, 55.4 years [SD, 17.1 years]; 98 women [66.2%]) with no documented bleeding. In the discovery cohort, 4 SNPs in linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 6 (rs115112393, rs16871327, rs78132896, and rs114504854) were associated with warfarin-related bleeding but did not reach genome-wide significance. The SNP rs78132896 occurred in 11 cases (35.5%) and 9 controls (4.9%) in the discovery cohort (OR, 8.31; 95% CI, 3.2-21.5; P < 6.21 × 10-8), and the association was confirmed in the replication cohort (the SNP was present in 14 cases [35.0%] and 7 controls [4.8%]; OR, 8.24; 95% CI, 3.1-25.3, P = 5.64 × 10-5). Genome-wide significance of this SNP was achieved when the cohorts were combined via meta-analysis (OR, 8.27; 95% CI, 4.18-16.38; P = 2.05 × 10-11). These SNPs are found only in people of African descent. In vitro luciferase expression assays demonstrated that rs16871327 (enhancer SNP) and rs78132896 (promoter SNP) risk alleles together increased EPHA7 gene (Entrez Gene 2045) transcription by a mean of 14.95 (SD, 1.7) compared with wild-type alleles (mean, 9.56 [SD, 0.84]; difference, 5.39; 95% CI, 4.1-6.6; P < .001). In this preliminary study involving patients of African descent taking warfarin, 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 6 were associated with an increased risk of major bleeding at INR of less than 4. Validation of these findings in an independent prospective cohort is required.
30281099	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies BARX1 and EML4-MTA3 as new loci associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.	Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a disorder of young infants with a population incidence of ∼2/1000 live births, caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter smooth muscle. Reported genetic loci associated with IHPS explain only a minor proportion of IHPS risk. To identify new risk loci, we carried out a genome-wide meta-analysis on 1395 surgery-confirmed cases and 4438 controls, with replication in a set of 2427 cases and 2524 controls. We identified and replicated six independent genomic loci associated with IHPS risk at genome wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8), including novel associations with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One of these SNPs, rs6736913 [odds ratio (OR) = 2.32; P = 3.0 × 10-15], is a low frequency missense variant in EML4 at 2p21. The second SNP, rs1933683 (OR = 1.34; P = 3.1 × 10-9) is 1 kb downstream of BARX1 at 9q22.32, an essential gene for stomach formation in embryogenesis. Using the genome-wide complex trait analysis method, we estimated the IHPS SNP heritability to be 30%, and using the linkage disequilibrium score regression method, we found support for a previously reported genetic correlation of IHPS with lipid metabolism. By combining the largest collection of IHPS cases to date (3822 cases), with results generalized across populations of different ancestry, we elucidate novel mechanistic avenues of IHPS disease architecture.
30281874	Genome-wide association study identifies gastric cancer susceptibility loci at 12q24.11-12 and 20q11.21.	Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality in Japan and worldwide. Although previous studies identify various genetic variations associated with gastric cancer, host genetic factors are largely unidentified. To identify novel gastric cancer loci in the Japanese population, herein, we carried out a large-scale genome-wide association study using 6171 cases and 27 178 controls followed by three replication analyses. Analysis using a total of 11 507 cases and 38 904 controls identified two novel loci on 12q24.11-12 (rs6490061, P = 3.20 × 10(-8) with an odds ratio [OR] of 0.905) and 20q11.21 (rs2376549, P = 8.11 × 10(-10) with an OR of 1.109). rs6490061 is located at intron 19 of the CUX2 gene, and its expression was suppressed by Helicobacter pylori infection. rs2376549 is included within the gene cluster of DEFB families that encode antibacterial peptides. We also found a significant association of rs7849280 in the ABO gene locus on 9q34.2 (P = 2.64 × 10(-13) with an OR of 1.148). CUX2 and ABO expression in gastric mucosal tissues was significantly associated with rs6490061 and rs7849280 (P = 0.0153 and 8.00 × 10(-11) ), respectively. Our findings show the crucial roles of genetic variations in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.
30284222	Genome-wide association analysis suggests novel loci for Hashimoto's thyroiditis.	Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common form of autoimmune thyroid diseases. Current knowledge of HT genetics is limited, and not a single genome-wide association study (GWAS) focusing exclusively on HT has been performed to date. In order to decipher genetic determinants of HT, we performed the first GWAS followed by replication in a total of 1443 individuals from Croatia. We performed association analysis in a discovery cohort comprising 405 cases and 433 controls. We followed up 13 independent signals (P < 10(-5)) in 303 cases and 302 controls from two replication cohorts and then meta-analyzed results across discovery and replication datasets. We identified three variants suggestively associated with HT: rs12944194 located 206 kb from SDK2 (P = 1.8 × 10(-6)), rs75201096 inside GNA14 (P = 2.41 × 10(-5)) and rs791903 inside IP6K3 (P = 3.16 × 10(-5)). Genetic risk score (GRS), calculated using risk alleles of these loci, accounted for 4.82% of the total HT variance, and individuals from the top GRS quartile had 2.76 times higher odds for HT than individuals from the lowest GRS quartile. Although discovered loci are implicated with susceptibility to HT for the first time, genomic regions harboring these loci exhibit good biological candidacy due to involvement in the regulation of the thyroid function and autoimmunity. Additionally, we observe genetic overlap between HT and several related traits, such as hypothyroidism, Graves' disease and TPOAb. Our study adds a new knowledge of underlying HT genetics and sets a firm basis for further research.
30287856	Genome-wide association study identifies two risk loci for tuberculosis in Han Chinese.	Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and remains a leading public health problem. Previous studies have identified host genetic factors that contribute to Mtb infection outcomes. However, much of the heritability in TB remains unaccounted for and additional susceptibility loci most likely exist. We perform a multistage genome-wide association study on 2949 pulmonary TB patients and 5090 healthy controls (833 cases and 1220 controls were genome-wide genotyped) from Han Chinese population. We discover two risk loci: 14q24.3 (rs12437118, P(combined) = 1.72 × 10(-11), OR = 1.277, ESRRB) and 20p13 (rs6114027, P(combined) = 2.37 × 10(-11), OR = 1.339, TGM6). Moreover, we determine that the rs6114027 risk allele is related to decreased TGM6 transcripts in PBMCs from pulmonary TB patients and severer pulmonary TB disease. Furthermore, we find that tgm6-deficient mice are more susceptible to Mtb infection. Our results provide new insights into the genetic etiology of TB.
30284742	A genome-wide association study identifies an association between variants in EFCAB4B gene and periodontal disease in an Italian isolated population.	Periodontitis in one of the most prevalent dental diseases. Despite numerous studies have investigated its aetiopathogenetic factors, few works have focused on its genetic predisposition and most of them took into account only candidate genes. Therefore, we conducted a Genome Wide Association Study in an Italian isolated population aimed at uncovering genetic variants that predispose to this disorder. Diagnosis of chronic periodontitis was made following the criteria of the American Academy of Periodontology. Patients with chronic periodontitis were grouped into different categories: slight, severe, localized and generalized. A control group composed by people without signs of periodontitis or gingivitis was defined. DNA was genotyped using 370k Illumina chips. Linear mixed model regression was used to test the association between each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (independent variable) and the periodontitis status (dependent variable), controlling for confounders sex, age and smoking. The genomic kinship matrix was also used as random effect. Four SNPs on the gene EFCAB4B resulted significantly associated to localized periodontitis (P < 5 × 10(-8) ), with the best hit on the rs242016 SNP (P = 1.5 × 10(-8) ). We have identified a novel significant association between the EFCAB4B gene and localized periodontitis. These results open a new perspective in the understanding of genetic factors contributing to this common disorder.
30287806	Genome-wide association study identifies glutamate ionotropic receptor GRIA4 as a risk gene for comorbid nicotine dependence and major depression.	Smoking and major depression frequently co-occur, at least in part due to shared genetic risk. However, the nature of the shared genetic basis is poorly understood. To detect genetic risk variants for comorbid nicotine dependence (ND) and major depression (MD), we conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two samples of African-American participants (Yale-Penn 1 and 2) using linear mixed model, followed by meta-analysis. 3724 nicotine-exposed subjects were analyzed: 2596 from Yale-Penn-1 and 1128 from Yale-Penn-2. Continuous measures (Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores and DSM-IV MD criteria) rather than disorder status were used to maximize the power of the GWAS. Genotypes were ascertained using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad array (Yale-Penn-1 sample) or the Illumina HumanCore Exome array (Yale-Penn-2 sample), followed by imputation based on the 1000 Genomes reference panel. An intronic variant at the GRIA4 locus, rs68081839, was significantly associated with ND-MD comorbidity (β = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.43-0.89], P = 1.53 × 10(-8)). GRIA4 encodes an AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor that mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuroplasticity. Conditional analyses revealed that the association was explained jointly by both traits. Enrichment analysis showed that the top risk genes and genes co-expressed with GRIA4 are enriched in cell adhesion, calcium ion binding, and synapses. They also have enriched expression in the brain and they have been implicated in the risk for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Further research is needed to determine the replicability of these findings and to identify the biological mechanisms through which genetic risk for each condition is conveyed.
30338293	Plasticity-related gene 3 (	To identify modifiers of age at diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) included 1,950 individuals with PD from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium (NGRC) study. Replication was conducted in the Parkinson's, Genes and Environment study, including 209 prevalent (PAGE(P)) and 517 incident (PAGE(I)) PD cases. Cox regression was used to test association with age at diagnosis. Individuals without neurologic disease were used to rule out confounding. Gene-level analysis and functional annotation were conducted using Functional Mapping and Annotation of GWAS platform (FUMA). The GWAS revealed 2 linked but seemingly independent association signals that mapped to(LPPR1) on chromosome 9.(LPPR1) was significant in gene-based analysis ((p) = 1E-8). The top signal (rs17763929, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.88,(p) = 5E-8) replicated in PAGE(P) (HR = 1.87,(p) = 0.01) but not in PAGE(I). The second signal (rs73656147) was robust with no evidence of heterogeneity (HR = 1.95,(p) = 3E-6 in NGRC; HR = 2.14,(p) = 1E-3 in PAGE(P) + PAGE(I), and HR = 2.00,(p) = 9E-9 in meta-analysis of NGRC + PAGE(P) + PAGE(I)). The associations were with age at diagnosis, not confounded by age in patients or in the general population. The PD-associated regions included variants with Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores = 10-19 (top 1%-10% most deleterious mutations in the genome), a missense with predicted destabilizing effect on LPPR1, an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for(GRIN3A) (false discovery rate [FDR] = 4E-4), and variants that overlap with enhancers in(LPPR1) and interact with promoters of(LPPR1) and 9 other brain-expressed genes (Hi-C FDR < 1E-6). Through association with age at diagnosis, we uncovered(LPPR1) as a modifier gene for PD.(LPPR1) expression promotes neuronal regeneration after injury in animal models. Present data provide a strong foundation for mechanistic studies to test(LPPR1) as a driver of response to damage and a therapeutic target for enhancing neuroregeneration and slowing disease progression.
30299488	Genome-Wide Association Study of Susceptibility Loci for Radiation-Induced Brain Injury.	Radiation-induced brain injury is a nonnegligible issue in the management of cancer patients treated by partial or whole brain irradiation. In particular, temporal lobe injury (TLI), a deleterious late complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, greatly affects the long-term life quality of these patients. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with radiation toxicity, genetic variants contributing to the radiation-induced brain injury have not yet been assessed. We recruited and performed follow-up for a prospective observational cohort, Genetic Architecture of Radiotherapy Toxicity and Prognosis, using magnetic resonance imaging for TLI diagnosis. We conducted genome-wide association analysis in 1082 patients and validated the top associations in two independent cohorts of 1119 and 741 patients, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided. We identified a promoter variant rs17111237 (A > G, minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.14) in CEP128 associated with TLI risk (hazard ratio = 1.45, 95% confidence interval = 1.26 to 1.66, Pcombined=3.18 × 10-7) which is in moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs162171 (MAF = 0.18, R2 = 0.69), the top signal in CEP128 (hazard ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval = 1.29-1.66, Pcombined= 6.17 × 10-9). Combining the clinical variables with the top SNP, we divided the patients into different subgroups with varying risk with 5-year TLI-free rates ranging from 33.7% to 95.5%. CEP128, a key component of mother centriole, tightly interacts with multiple radiation-resistant genes and plays an important role in maintaining the functional cilia, which otherwise will lead to a malfunction of the neural network. We found that A > G alteration at rs17111237 impaired the promoter activity of CEP128 and knockdown of CEP128 decreased the clonogenic cell survival of U87 cells under radiation. Noteworthy, 12.7% (27/212) of the GWAS-based associated genes (P < .001) were enriched in the neurogenesis pathway. This three-stage study is the first GWAS of radiation-induced brain injury that implicates the genetic susceptibility gene CEP128 involved in TLI development and provides the novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of radiation-induced brain injury.
30297428	Genetic variation in the 	Erectile dysfunction affects millions of men worldwide. Twin studies support the role of genetic risk factors underlying erectile dysfunction, but no specific genetic variants have been identified. We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study of erectile dysfunction in 36,649 men in the multiethnic Kaiser Permanente Northern California Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging cohort. We also undertook replication analyses in 222,358 men from the UK Biobank. In the discovery cohort, we identified a single locus (rs17185536-T) on chromosome 6 near the single-minded family basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1 ((SIM1)) gene that was significantly associated with the risk of erectile dysfunction (odds ratio = 1.26,(P) = 3.4 × 10(-25)). The association replicated in the UK Biobank sample (odds ratio = 1.25,(P) = 6.8 × 10(-14)), and the effect is independent of known erectile dysfunction risk factors, including body mass index (BMI). The risk locus resides on the same topologically associating domain as(SIM1) and interacts with the(SIM1) promoter, and the rs17185536-T risk allele showed differential enhancer activity.(SIM1) is part of the leptin-melanocortin system, which has an established role in body weight homeostasis and sexual function. Because the variants associated with erectile dysfunction are not associated with differences in BMI, our findings suggest a mechanism that is specific to sexual function.
30305637	Two high-risk susceptibility loci at 6p25.3 and 14q32.13 for Waldenström macroglobulinemia.	Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM)/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) is a rare, chronic B-cell lymphoma with high heritability. We conduct a two-stage genome-wide association study of WM/LPL in 530 unrelated cases and 4362 controls of European ancestry and identify two high-risk loci associated with WM/LPL at 6p25.3 (rs116446171, near EXOC2 and IRF4; OR = 21.14, 95% CI: 14.40-31.03, P = 1.36 × 10(-54)) and 14q32.13 (rs117410836, near TCL1; OR = 4.90, 95% CI: 3.45-6.96, P = 8.75 × 10(-19)). Both risk alleles are observed at a low frequency among controls (~2-3%) and occur in excess in affected cases within families. In silico data suggest that rs116446171 may have functional importance, and in functional studies, we demonstrate increased reporter transcription and proliferation in cells transduced with the 6p25.3 risk allele. Although further studies are needed to fully elucidate underlying biological mechanisms, together these loci explain 4% of the familial risk and provide insights into genetic susceptibility to this malignancy.
30317457	Genome-wide association study of primary open-angle glaucoma in continental and admixed African populations.	Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a complex disease with a major genetic contribution. Its prevalence varies greatly among ethnic groups, and is up to five times more frequent in black African populations compared to Europeans. So far, worldwide efforts to elucidate the genetic complexity of POAG in African populations has been limited. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 1113 POAG cases and 1826 controls from Tanzanian, South African and African American study samples. Apart from confirming evidence of association at TXNRD2 (rs16984299; OR([T]) 1.20; P = 0.003), we found that a genetic risk score combining the effects of the 15 previously reported POAG loci was significantly associated with POAG in our samples (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.26-1.93; P = 4.79 × 10(-5)). By genome-wide association testing we identified a novel candidate locus, rs141186647, harboring EXOC4 (OR([A]) 0.48; P = 3.75 × 10(-8)), a gene transcribing a component of the exocyst complex involved in vesicle transport. The low frequency and high degree of genetic heterogeneity at this region hampered validation of this finding in predominantly West-African replication sets. Our results suggest that established genetic risk factors play a role in African POAG, however, they do not explain the higher disease load. The high heterogeneity within Africans remains a challenge to identify the genetic commonalities for POAG in this ethnicity, and demands studies of extremely large size.
30320955	Identification of Novel Loci Associated With Hip Shape: A Meta-Analysis of Genomewide Association Studies.	We aimed to report the first genomewide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived hip shape, which is thought to be related to the risk of both hip osteoarthritis and hip fracture. Ten hip shape modes (HSMs) were derived by statistical shape modeling using SHAPE software, from hip DXA scans in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; adult females), TwinsUK (mixed sex), Framingham Osteoporosis Study (FOS; mixed), Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study (MrOS), and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF; females) (total N = 15,934). Associations were adjusted for age, sex, and ancestry. Five genomewide significant (p < 5 × 10(-9) , adjusted for 10 independent outcomes) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with HSM1, and three SNPs with HSM2. One SNP, in high linkage disequilibrium with rs2158915 associated with HSM1, was associated with HSM5 at genomewide significance. In a look-up of previous GWASs, three of the identified SNPs were associated with hip osteoarthritis, one with hip fracture, and five with height. Seven SNPs were within 200 kb of genes involved in endochondral bone formation, namely SOX9, PTHrP, RUNX1, NKX3-2, FGFR4, DICER1, and HHIP. The SNP adjacent to DICER1 also showed osteoblast cis-regulatory activity of GSC, in which mutations have previously been reported to cause hip dysplasia. For three of the lead SNPs, SNPs in high LD (r(2)  > 0.5) were identified, which intersected with open chromatin sites as detected by ATAC-seq performed on embryonic mouse proximal femora. In conclusion, we identified eight SNPs independently associated with hip shape, most of which were associated with height and/or mapped close to endochondral bone formation genes, consistent with a contribution of processes involved in limb growth to hip shape and pathological sequelae. These findings raise the possibility that genetic studies of hip shape might help in understanding potential pathways involved in hip osteoarthritis and hip fracture. © 2018 The Authors.

30339177	The 677C→T variant of MTHFR is the major genetic modifier of biomarkers of folate status in a young, healthy Irish population.	Genetic polymorphisms can explain some of the population- and individual-based variations in nutritional status biomarkers. We sought to screen the entire human genome for common genetic polymorphisms that influence folate-status biomarkers in healthy individuals. We carried out candidate gene analyses and genome-wide association scans in 2232 young, healthy Irish subjects to evaluate which common genetic polymorphisms influence red blood cell folate, serum folate, and plasma total homocysteine. The 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C→T (rs1801133) variant was the major genetic modifier of all 3 folate-related biomarkers in this Irish population and reached genome-wide significance for red blood cell folate (P = 1.37 × 10-17), serum folate (P = 2.82 × 10-11), and plasma total homocysteine (P = 1.26 × 10-19) concentrations. A second polymorphism in the MTHFR gene (rs3753584, P = 1.09 × 10-11) was the only additional MTHFR variant to exhibit any significant independent effect on red blood cell folate. Other MTHFR variants, including the 1298A→C variant (rs1801131), appeared to reach genome-wide significance, but these variants shared linkage disequilibrium with MTHFR 677C→T and were not significant when analyzed in MTHFR 677CC homozygotes. No additional non-MTHFR modifiers of red blood cell or plasma folate were detected. Two additional genome-wide significant modifiers of plasma homocysteine were found in the region of the dipeptidase 1 (DPEP1) gene on chromosome 16 and the Twist neighbor B (TWISTNB) gene on chromosome 7. The MTHFR 677C→T variant is the predominant genetic modifier of folate status biomarkers in this healthy Irish population. It is not necessary to determine MTHFR 677C→T genotype to evaluate folate status because its effect is reflected in concentrations of standard folate biomarkers. The MTHFR 1298A→C variant had no independent effect on folate status biomarkers. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide association study report on red blood cell folate and the first report of an association between homocysteine and TWISTNB.
30374069	Meta-analysis of Icelandic and UK data sets identifies missense variants in SMO, IL11, COL11A1 and 13 more new loci associated with osteoarthritis.	Osteoarthritis has a highly negative impact on quality of life because of the associated pain and loss of joint function. Here we describe the largest meta-analysis so far of osteoarthritis of the hip and the knee in samples from Iceland and the UK Biobank (including 17,151 hip osteoarthritis patients, 23,877 knee osteoarthritis patients, and more than 562,000 controls). We found 23 independent associations at 22 loci in the additive meta-analyses, of which 16 of the loci were novel: 12 for hip and 4 for knee osteoarthritis. Two associations are between rare or low-frequency missense variants and hip osteoarthritis, affecting the genes SMO (rs143083812, frequency 0.11%, odds ratio (OR) = 2.8, P = 7.9 × 10(-12), p.Arg173Cys) and IL11 (rs4252548, frequency 2.08%, OR = 1.30, P = 2.1 × 10(-11), p.Arg112His). A common missense variant in the COL11A1 gene also associates with hip osteoarthritis (rs3753841, frequency 61%, P = 5.2 × 10(-10), OR = 1.08, p.Pro1284Leu). In addition, using a recessive model, we confirm an association between hip osteoarthritis and a variant of CHADL(1) (rs117018441, P = 1.8 × 10(-25), OR = 5.9). Furthermore, we observe a complex relationship between height and risk of osteoarthritis.
30373671	Childhood asthma is associated with COPD and known asthma variants in COPDGene: a genome-wide association study.	Childhood asthma is strongly influenced by genetics and is a risk factor for reduced lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. This study investigates self-reported childhood asthma in adult smokers from the COPDGene Study. We hypothesize that childhood asthma is associated with decreased lung function, increased risk for COPD, and that a genome-wide association study (GWAS) will show association with established asthma variants. We evaluated current and former smokers ages 45-80 of non-Hispanic white (NHW) or African American (AA) race. Childhood asthma was defined by self-report of asthma, diagnosed by a medical professional, with onset at < 16 years or during childhood. Subjects with a history of childhood asthma were compared to those who never had asthma based on lung function, development of COPD, and genetic variation. GWAS was performed in NHW and AA populations, and combined in meta-analysis. Two sets of established asthma SNPs from published literature were examined for association with childhood asthma. Among 10,199 adult smokers, 730 (7%) reported childhood asthma and 7493 (73%) reported no history of asthma. Childhood asthmatics had reduced lung function and increased risk for COPD (OR 3.42, 95% CI 2.81-4.18). Genotype data was assessed for 8031 subjects. Among NHWs, 391(7%) had childhood asthma, and GWAS identified one genome-wide significant association in KIAA1958 (rs59289606, p = 4.82 × 10(- 8)). Among AAs, 339 (12%) had childhood asthma. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the AAs or in the meta-analysis combining NHW and AA subjects; however, potential regions of interest were identified. Established asthma SNPs were examined, seven from the NHGRI-EBI database and five with genome-wide significance in the largest pediatric asthma GWAS. Associations were found in the current childhood asthma GWAS with known asthma loci in IL1RL1, IL13, LINC01149, near GSDMB, and in the C11orf30-LRRC32 region (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Childhood asthmatics are at increased risk for COPD. Defining asthma by self-report is valid in populations at risk for COPD, identifying subjects with clinical and genetic characteristics known to associate with childhood asthma. This has potential to improve clinical understanding of asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) and enhance future research into ACO-specific treatment regimens. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00608764 (Active since January 28, 2008).
30377885	Bactericidal/Permeability-Increasing Fold-Containing Family B Member 4 May Be Associated with NSAID-Induced Enteropathy.	There is considerable individual variability in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced enteropathy. To identify the SNP that is most significantly involved with NSAID-induced enteropathy. One hundred fifty human subjects who were known to have a certain degree of loxoprofen- or celecoxib-induced small-intestinal damage from a previous study were enrolled. The subjects were divided into groups based on treatments and also on the increased number of small intestinal mucosal breaks. The candidate SNP was selected by an initial analysis of GWAS among the groups in various combinations. After the initial analysis, the gene including the specified SNP was analyzed in detail using GWAS and genotype imputation. After analysis, 70 subjects receiving the loxoprofen treatment and 69 subjects receiving celecoxib treatment were determined to be eligible for the analysis. The minimum p value in GWAS was detected in the analysis of 16 cases with an increase of five or more mucosal breaks and 123 controls with zero to four mucosal breaks. In the GWAS, five SNPs in the bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold-containing family B member 4 (BPIFB4) gene showed the lowest p value (p = 2.69 × 10(-7) with an odds ratio of 40.9). Of the five SNPs, four were nonsynonymous SNPs (rs2070325: V268I, rs2889732: T320N, rs11699009: F527L, rs11696307: T533I, and rs11696310: intronic). Furthermore, 23 SNPs in BPIFB4 detected by genotype imputation based on the GWAS data also showed suggestive associations (p < 1 × 10(-6)). The results indicate that SNPs in BPIFB4 were associated with NSAID-induced small intestinal mucosal injury (UMIN: 000007936).
30378284	Moderating effect of mode of delivery on the genetics of intelligence: Explorative genome-wide analyses in ALSPAC.	Intelligence is a core construct of individual differences in cognitive abilities and a strong predictor of important life outcomes. Within recent years, rates of cesarean section have substantially increased globally, though little is known about its effect on neurodevelopmental trajectories. Thus, we aimed to investigate the influence of delivery by cesarean section on the genetics of intelligence in children. Participants were recruited through the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Intelligence was measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human Hap 550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping platform and was followed by imputation using MACH software. Genome-wide interaction analyses were conducted using linear regression. A total of 2,421 children and 2,141,747 SNPs were subjected to the genome-wide interaction analyses. No variant reached genome-wide significance. The strongest interaction was observed at rs17800861 in the GRIN2A gene (β = -3.43, 95% CI = -4.74 to -2.12, p = 2.98E-07). This variant is predicted to be located within active chromatin compartments in the hippocampus and may influence binding of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Our results may indicate that mode of delivery might have a moderating effect on genetic disposition of intelligence in children. Studies of considerable sizes (>10,000) are likely required to more robustly detect variants governing such interaction. In summary, the presented findings prompt the need for further studies aimed at increasing our understanding of effects various modes of delivery may have on health outcomes in children.
30480742	Genome-Wide Association Study to Identify a New Susceptibility Locus for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy in the Japanese Population.	Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a retinal disorder that often affects the vision of middle-aged people yet the molecular mechanisms of CSC remain unknown. This study was conducted to identify genetic factors influencing individual differences in susceptibility to CSC. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted with a total of 320 unrelated Japanese idiopathic CSC cases and 3245 population-based controls. In a discovery stage, 137 unrelated Japanese idiopathic CSC cases and 1174 population-based controls were subjected to GWAS, followed by a replication study using an additional 183 individuals with idiopathic CSC and 2071 population-based volunteers. The results of the discovery and replication stages were combined to conduct a meta-analysis. In the two-stage GWAS, rs11865049 located at SLC7A5 in chromosome 16q24.2 was identified as a novel disease susceptibility locus for CSC, as evident from the discovery and replication results using meta-analysis (combined P = 9.71 × 10-9, odds ratio = 2.10). The results of the present study demonstrated that SLC7A5 might be the potential candidate gene associated with CSC, indicating a previously unidentified molecular mechanism of CSC.
30383316	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 3 novel loci associated with stroke.	We conducted a European-only and transancestral genome-wide association meta-analysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in NOS3 (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; p = 2.2E-8, odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.07) and variants in an intron of COL4A1 (rs9521634; p = 3.8E-8, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03-1.06) and near DYRK1A (rs720470; p = 6.1E-9, OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03-1.07) at genome-wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian randomization, we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.

30395268	Genome-wide meta-analysis and replication studies in multiple ethnicities identify novel adolescent idiopathic scoliosis susceptibility loci.	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder of childhood development. The genetic architecture of AIS is complex, and the great majority of risk factors are undiscovered. To identify new AIS susceptibility loci, we conducted the first genome-wide meta-analysis of AIS genome-wide association studies, including 7956 cases and 88 459 controls from 3 ancestral groups. Three novel loci that surpassed genome-wide significance were uncovered in intragenic regions of the CDH13 (P-value_rs4513093 = 1.7E-15), ABO (P-value_ rs687621 = 7.3E-10) and SOX6 (P-value_rs1455114 = 2.98E-08) genes. Restricting the analysis to females improved the associations at multiple loci, most notably with variants within CDH13 despite the reduction in sample size. Genome-wide gene-functional enrichment analysis identified significant perturbation of pathways involving cartilage and connective tissue development. Expression of both SOX6 and CDH13 was detected in cartilage chondrocytes and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments in that tissue revealed multiple HeK27ac-positive peaks overlapping associated loci. Our results further define the genetic architecture of AIS and highlight the importance of vertebral cartilage development in its pathogenesis.
30596066	Genome-wide association study identifies 	Fluorodeoxyglucose f18 positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) is regarded as the only functional neuroimaging biomarker for degeneration which can be used to increase the certainty of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiological process in research settings or as an optional clinical tool where available. Although a decline in FDG metabolism was confirmed in some regions known to be associated with AD, there was little known about the genetic association of FDG metabolism in AD cohorts. In this study, we present the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of brain FDG metabolism. A total of 222 individuals were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort. All subjects were restricted to non-Hispanic Caucasians and met all quality control (QC) criteria. Associations of 18F-FDG with the genetic variants were assessed using PLINK 1.07 under the additive genetic model. Genome-wide associations were visualized using a software program R 3.2.3. One significant SNP rs12444565 in RNA-binding Fox1 ((RBFOX1)) was found to have a strong association with 18F-FDG (P=6.06×10(-8)). Rs235141, rs79037, rs12526331 and rs12529764 were identified as four suggestive loci associated with 18F-FDG. Our study results suggest that a genome-wide significant SNP (rs12444565) in the(RBFOX1), and four suggestive loci (rs235141, rs79037, rs12526331 and rs12529764) are associated with 18F-FDG.
30392061	Genetic association and differential expression of PITX2 with acute appendicitis.	Appendicitis affects 9% of Americans and is the most common diagnosis requiring hospitalization of both children and adults. We performed a genome-wide association study of self-reported appendectomy with 18,773 affected adults and 114,907 unaffected adults of European American ancestry. A significant association with appendectomy was observed at 4q25 near the gene PITX2 (rs2129979, p value = 8.82 × 10(-14)) and was replicated in an independent sample of Caucasians (59 affected, 607 unaffected; p value = 0.005). Meta-analysis of the associated variant across our two cohorts and cohorts from Iceland and the Netherlands (in which this association had previously been reported) showed strong cumulative evidence of association (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.09-1.14; p value = 1.81 × 10(-23)) and some evidence for effect heterogeneity (p value = 0.03). Eight other loci were identified at suggestive significance in the discovery GWAS. Associations were followed up by measuring gene expression across resected appendices with varying levels of inflammation (N = 75). We measured expression of 27 genes based on physical proximity to the GWAS signals, evidence of being targeted by eQTLs near the signals according to RegulomeDB (score = 1), or both. Four of the 27 genes (including PITX2) showed significant evidence (p values < 0.0033) of differential expression across categories of appendix inflammation. An additional ten genes showed nominal evidence (p value < 0.05) of differential expression, which, together with the significant genes, is more than expected by chance (p value = 6.6 × 10(-12)). PITX2 impacts morphological development of intestinal tissue, promotes an anti-oxidant response, and its expression correlates with levels of intestinal bacteria and colonic inflammation. Further studies of the role of PITX2 in appendicitis are warranted.
30412241	Genome-wide association study of cervical cancer suggests a role for ARRDC3 gene in human papillomavirus infection.	The development of cervical cancer is initiated by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and involves both viral and host genetic factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cervical cancer have identified associations in the HLA locus and two loci outside HLA, but the principal genes that control infection and pathogenesis have not been identified. In the present study, we performed GWAS of cervical cancer in East Asian populations, involving 2609 cases and 4712 controls in the discovery stage and 1461 cases and 3295 controls in the follow-up stage. We identified novel-significant associations at 5q14 with the lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs59661306 (P = 2.4 × 10-11) and at 7p11 with the lead SNP rs7457728 (P = 1.2 × 10-8). In 5q14, the chromatin region of the GWAS-significant SNPs was found to be in contact with the promoter of the ARRDC3 (arrestin domain-containing 3) gene. In our functional studies, ARRDC3 knockdown in HeLa cells caused significant reductions in both cell growth and susceptibility to HPV16 pseudovirion infection, suggesting that ARRDC3 is involved in the infectious entry of HPV into the cell. Our study advances the understanding of host genes that are responsible for cervical cancer susceptibility and guides future research on HPV infection and cancer development.
30431558	Genome-wide association reveals contribution of MRAS to painful temporomandibular disorder in males.	Painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are the leading cause of chronic orofacial pain, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Although many environmental factors have been associated with higher risk of developing painful TMD, family and twin studies support a heritable genetic component as well. We performed a genome-wide association study assuming an additive genetic model of TMD in a discovery cohort of 999 cases and 2031 TMD-free controls from the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study. Using logistic models adjusted for sex, age, enrollment site, and race, we identified 3 distinct loci that were significant in combined or sex-segregated analyses. A single-nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 3 (rs13078961) was significantly associated with TMD in males only (odds ratio = 2.9, 95% confidence interval: 2.02-4.27, P = 2.2 × 10). This association was nominally replicated in a meta-analysis of 7 independent orofacial pain cohorts including 160,194 participants (odds ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.0-1.35, P = 2.3 × 10). Functional analysis in human dorsal root ganglia and blood indicated this variant is an expression quantitative trait locus, with the minor allele associated with decreased expression of the nearby muscle RAS oncogene homolog (MRAS) gene (beta = -0.51, P = 2.43 × 10). Male mice, but not female mice, with a null mutation of Mras displayed persistent mechanical allodynia in a model of inflammatory pain. Genetic and behavioral evidence support a novel mechanism by which genetically determined MRAS expression moderates the resiliency to chronic pain. This effect is male-specific and may contribute to the lower rates of painful TMD in men.
30498476	Heritability and Genome-Wide Association Study of Plasma Cholesterol in Chinese Adult Twins.	Dyslipidemia represents a strong and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Plasma cholesterol, such as total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), is the common indicator of diagnosing dyslipidemia. Here based on 382 Chinese twin pairs, we explored the magnitude of genetic impact on TC, HDL-C, LDL-C variation and further searched for genetic susceptibility loci for them using genome-wide association study (GWAS). The ACE model was the best fit model with additive genetic parameter (A) accounting for 26.6%, common or shared environmental parameter (C) accounting for 47.8%, unique/non-shared environmental parameter (E) accounting for 25.6% for the variance in HDL-C. The AE model was the best fit model for TC (A: 61.4%; E: 38.6%) and LDL-C (A: 65.5%; E: 34.5%). While no SNPs reached the genome-wide significance level ((P) < 5 × 10(-8)), 8, 14, 9 SNPs exceeded the suggestive significance level ((P) < 1 × 10(-5)) for TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, respectively. The promising genetic regions for TC, HDL-C, LDL-C were on chromosome 11 around rs7107698, chromosome 5 around rs12518218, chromosome 2 around rs10490120, respectively. Gene-based analysis found 1038, 1033 and 1090 genes nominally associated with TC, HDL-C, LDL-C ((P) < 0.05), especially(FAF1, KLKB1) for TC,(KLKB1) for HDL-C, and(NTRK1, FAF1, SNTB2) for LDL-C, respectively. The number of common related genes among TC, HDL-C and LDL-C was 71, including(FAF1, KLKB1), etc. Pathway enrichment analysis discovered known related pathways-zinc transporters, metal ion SLC transporters for TC, cell adhesion molecules CAMs, IL-6 signaling for HDL, FC epsilon RI signaling pathway, NFAT pathway for LDL, respectively. In conclusion, the TC and LDL-C level is moderately heritable and the HDL-C level is lowly heritable in Chinese population. The genomic loci, functional genes and pathways are identified to account for the heritability of plasma cholesterol level. Our findings provide important insights into plasma cholesterol molecular physiology and expect future research to replicate and validate our results.
30450575	Genetic predisposition to PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity in children treated according to NOPHO ALL2008.	Asparaginase is essential in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treatment, however hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) hampers anti-neoplastic efficacy. Patients with PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity have been shown to possess zero asparaginase enzyme activity. Using this measurement to define the phenotype, we investigated genetic predisposition to PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). From July 2008 to March 2016, 1494 children were treated on the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol. Cases were defined by clinical hypersensitivity and no enzyme activity, controls had enzyme activity ≥ 100 iu/l and no hypersensitivity symptoms. PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity was reported in 13·8% (206/1494) of patients. Fifty-nine cases and 772 controls fulfilled GWAS inclusion criteria. The CNOT3 variant rs73062673 on 19q13.42, was associated with PEG-asparaginase allergy (P = 4·68 × 10(-8) ). We further identified two signals on chromosome 6 in relation to HLA-DQA1 (P = 9·37 × 10(-6) ) and TAP2 (P = 1·59 × 10(-5) ). This study associated variants in CNOT3 and in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region with PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity, suggesting that not only genetic variations in the HLA region, but also regulation of these genes are of importance in the biology of this toxicity. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the importance of using asparaginase enzyme activity measurements to identify PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity.
30487263	Multiethnic Genome-Wide Association Study of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Liability Threshold Modeling of Duration of Diabetes and Glycemic Control.	To identify genetic variants associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR), we performed a large multiethnic genome-wide association study. Discovery included eight European cohorts ((n) = 3,246) and seven African American cohorts ((n) = 2,611). We meta-analyzed across cohorts using inverse-variance weighting, with and without liability threshold modeling of glycemic control and duration of diabetes. Variants with a(P) value <1 × 10(-5) were investigated in replication cohorts that included 18,545 European, 16,453 Asian, and 2,710 Hispanic subjects. After correction for multiple testing, the C allele of rs142293996 in an intron of nuclear VCP-like ((NVL)) was associated with DR in European discovery cohorts ((P) = 2.1 × 10(-9)), but did not reach genome-wide significance after meta-analysis with replication cohorts. We applied the Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator (DAPPLE) to our discovery results to test for evidence of risk being spread across underlying molecular pathways. One protein-protein interaction network built from genes in regions associated with proliferative DR was found to have significant connectivity ((P) = 0.0009) and corroborated with gene set enrichment analyses. These findings suggest that genetic variation in(NVL,) as well as variation within a protein-protein interaction network that includes genes implicated in inflammation, may influence risk for DR.
30500874	A Genome-wide Association Study Identifying RAP1A as a Novel Susceptibility Gene for Crohn's Disease in Japanese Individuals.	Genome-wide association studies [GWASs] of European populations have identified numerous susceptibility loci for Crohn's disease [CD]. Susceptibility genes differ by ethnicity, however, so GWASs specific for Asian populations are required. This study aimed to clarify the Japanese-specific genetic background for CD by a GWAS using the Japonica array [JPA] and subsequent imputation with the 1KJPN reference panel. Two independent Japanese case/control sets (Tohoku region [379 CD patients, 1621 controls] and Kyushu region [334 CD patients, 462 controls]) were included. GWASs were performed separately for each population, followed by a meta-analysis. Two additional replication sets [254 + 516 CD patients and 287 + 565 controls] were analysed for top hit single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] from novel genomic regions. Genotype data of 4 335 144 SNPs from 713 Japanese CD patients and 2083 controls were analysed. SNPs located in TNFSF15 (rs78898421, Pmeta = 2.59 × 10-26, odds ratio [OR] = 2.10), HLA-DQB1 [rs184950714, pmeta = 3.56 × 10-19, OR = 2.05], ZNF365, and 4p14 loci were significantly associated with CD in Japanese individuals. Replication analyses were performed for four novel candidate loci [p <1 × 10-6], and rs488200 located upstream of RAP1A was significantly associated with CD [pcombined = 4.36 × 10-8, OR = 1.31]. Transcriptome analysis of CD4+ effector memory T cells from lamina propria mononuclear cells of CD patients revealed a significant association of rs488200 with RAP1A expression. RAP1A is a novel susceptibility locus for CD in the Japanese population.
30498034	Genetic determinants and an epistasis of 	Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a systemic vasculitis with severe complications that affects the aorta and its large branches. HLA-B*52 is an established susceptibility locus to TAK. To date, there are still only a limited number of reports concerning non-HLA susceptibility loci to TAK. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a follow-up study in a total of 633 TAK cases and 5,928 controls. A total of 510,879 SNPs were genotyped, and 5,875,450 SNPs were imputed together with HLA-B*52. Functional annotation of significant loci, enhancer enrichment, and pathway analyses were conducted. We identified four unreported significant loci, namely rs2322599, rs103294, rs17133698, and rs1713450, in(PTK2B),(LILRA3)/(LILRB2),(DUSP22), and(KLHL33), respectively. Two additional significant loci unreported in non-European GWAS were identified, namely(HSPA6)/(FCGR3A) and chr21q.22. We found that a single variant associated with the expression of(MICB), a ligand for natural killer (NK) cell receptor, could explain the entire association with the(HLA-B) region. Rs2322599 is strongly associated with the expression of(PTK2B) Rs103294 risk allele in(LILRA3)/(LILRB2) is known to be a tagging SNP for the deletion of(LILRA3), a soluble receptor of HLA class I molecules. We found a significant epistasis effect between HLA-B*52 and rs103294 ((P) = 1.2 × 10(-3)). Enhancer enrichment analysis and pathway analysis suggested the involvement of NK cells ((P) = 8.8 × 10(-5), enhancer enrichment). In conclusion, four unreported TAK susceptibility loci and an epistasis effect between(LILRA3) and HLA-B*52 were identified. HLA and non-HLA regions suggested a critical role for NK cells in TAK.
30578281	A locus on chromosome 5 shows African ancestry-limited association with alloimmunization in sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a critical therapeutic intervention in sickle cell disease (SCD); however, the apparent propensity of some patients to regularly develop RBC alloantibodies after transfusion presents a significant challenge to finding compatible blood for so-called alloimmunization responders. Predisposing genetic loci have long been thought to contribute to the responder phenomenon, but to date, no definitive loci have been identified. We undertook a genome-wide association study of alloimmunization responder status in 267 SCD multiple transfusion recipients, using genetic estimates of ancestral admixture to bolster our findings. Analyses revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosomes 2 and 5 approaching genome-wide significance (minimum(P) = 2.0 × 10(-8) and 8.4 × 10(-8), respectively), with local ancestry analysis demonstrating similar levels of admixture in responders and nonresponders at implicated loci. Association at chromosome 5 was nominally replicated in an independent cohort of 130 SCD transfusion recipients, with meta-analysis surpassing genome-wide significance (rs75853687,P = 6.6 × 10(-9)), and this extended to individuals forming multiple (>3) alloantibodies (P = 9.4 × 10(-5)). The associated variant is rare outside of African populations, and orthogonal genome-wide haplotype analyses, contingent on local ancestry, revealed genome-wide significant sharing of a ∼60-kb haplotype of African ancestry at the chromosome 5 locus (Bayes Factor = 4.95). This locus overlaps a putative(cis-)acting enhancer predicted to regulate transcription of(ADRA1B) and the lncRNA(LINC01847), both members of larger ontologies associated with immune regulation. Our findings provide potential insights to the pathophysiology underlying the development of alloantibodies and implicate non-RBC ancestry-limited loci in the susceptibility to alloimmunization.
30527956	Genetic determinants of risk in pulmonary arterial hypertension: international genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis.	Rare genetic variants cause pulmonary arterial hypertension, but the contribution of common genetic variation to disease risk and natural history is poorly characterised. We tested for genome-wide association for pulmonary arterial hypertension in large international cohorts and assessed the contribution of associated regions to outcomes. We did two separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a meta-analysis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. These GWAS used data from four international case-control studies across 11 744 individuals with European ancestry (including 2085 patients). One GWAS used genotypes from 5895 whole-genome sequences and the other GWAS used genotyping array data from an additional 5849 individuals. Cross-validation of loci reaching genome-wide significance was sought by meta-analysis. Conditional analysis corrected for the most significant variants at each locus was used to resolve signals for multiple associations. We functionally annotated associated variants and tested associations with duration of survival. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint in survival analyses. A locus near SOX17 (rs10103692, odds ratio 1·80 [95% CI 1·55-2·08], p=5·13 × 10(-15)) and a second locus in HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 (collectively referred to as HLA-DPA1/DPB1 here; rs2856830, 1·56 [1·42-1·71], p=7·65 × 10(-20)) within the class II MHC region were associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The SOX17 locus had two independent signals associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (rs13266183, 1·36 [1·25-1·48], p=1·69 × 10(-12); and rs10103692). Functional and epigenomic data indicate that the risk variants near SOX17 alter gene regulation via an enhancer active in endothelial cells. Pulmonary arterial hypertension risk variants determined haplotype-specific enhancer activity, and CRISPR-mediated inhibition of the enhancer reduced SOX17 expression. The HLA-DPA1/DPB1 rs2856830 genotype was strongly associated with survival. Median survival from diagnosis in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with the C/C homozygous genotype was double (13·50 years [95% CI 12·07 to >13·50]) that of those with the T/T genotype (6·97 years [6·02-8·05]), despite similar baseline disease severity. This is the first study to report that common genetic variation at loci in an enhancer near SOX17 and in HLA-DPA1/DPB1 is associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Impairment of SOX17 function might be more common in pulmonary arterial hypertension than suggested by rare mutations in SOX17. Further studies are needed to confirm the association between HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping and survival, and to determine whether HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping improves risk stratification in clinical practice or trials.

30529582	Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Study of East Asians Identifies Loci Associated With Risk for Colorectal Cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have associated approximately 50 loci with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)-nearly one third of these loci were initially associated with CRC in studies conducted in East Asian populations. We conducted a GWAS of East Asians to identify CRC risk loci and evaluate the generalizability of findings from GWASs of European populations to Asian populations. We analyzed genetic data from 22,775 patients with CRC (cases) and 47,731 individuals without cancer (controls) from 14 studies in the Asia Colorectal Cancer Consortium. First, we performed a meta-analysis of 7 GWASs (10,625 cases and 34,595 controls) and identified 46,554 promising risk variants for replication by adding them to the Multi-Ethnic Global Array (MEGA) for genotype analysis in 6445 cases and 7175 controls. These data were analyzed, along with data from an additional 5705 cases and 5961 controls genotyped using the OncoArray. We also obtained data from 57,976 cases and 67,242 controls of European descent. Variants at identified risk loci were functionally annotated and evaluated in correlation with gene expression levels. A meta-analyses of all samples from people of Asian descent identified 13 loci and 1 new variant at a known locus (10q24.2) associated with risk of CRC at the genome-wide significance level of P < 5 × 10(-8). We did not perform experiments to replicate these associations in additional individuals of Asian ancestry. However, the lead risk variant in 6 of these loci was also significantly associated with risk of CRC in European descendants. A strong association (44%-75% increase in risk per allele) was found for 2 low-frequency variants: rs201395236 at 1q44 (minor allele frequency, 1.34%) and rs77969132 at 12p11.21 (minor allele frequency, 1.53%). For 8 of the 13 associated loci, the variants with the highest levels of significant association were located inside or near the protein-coding genes L1TD1, EFCAB2, PPP1R21, SLCO2A1, HLA-G, NOTCH4, DENND5B, and GNAS. For other intergenic loci, we provided evidence for the possible involvement of the genes ALDH7A1, PRICKLE1, KLF5, WWOX, and GLP2R. We replicated findings for 41 of 52 previously reported risk loci. We showed that most of the risk loci previously associated with CRC risk in individuals of European descent were also associated with CRC risk in East Asians. Furthermore, we identified 13 loci significantly associated with risk for CRC in Asians. Many of these loci contained genes that regulate the immune response, Wnt signaling to β-catenin, prostaglandin E2 catabolism, and cell pluripotency and proliferation. Further analyses of these genes and their variants is warranted, particularly for the 8 loci for which the lead CRC risk variants were not replicated in persons of European descent.
30552067	Moderate-to-severe asthma in individuals of European ancestry: a genome-wide association study.	Few genetic studies that focus on moderate-to-severe asthma exist. We aimed to identity novel genetic variants associated with moderate-to-severe asthma, see whether previously identified genetic variants for all types of asthma contribute to moderate-to-severe asthma, and provide novel mechanistic insights using expression analyses in patients with asthma. In this genome-wide association study, we used a two-stage case-control design. In stage 1, we genotyped patient-level data from two UK cohorts (the Genetics of Asthma Severity and Phenotypes [GASP] initiative and the Unbiased BIOmarkers in PREDiction of respiratory disease outcomes [U-BIOPRED] project) and used data from the UK Biobank to collect patient-level genomic data for cases and controls of European ancestry in a 1:5 ratio. Cases were defined as having moderate-to-severe asthma if they were taking appropriate medication or had been diagnosed by a doctor. Controls were defined as not having asthma, rhinitis, eczema, allergy, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis as diagnosed by a doctor. For stage 2, an independent cohort of cases and controls (1:5) was selected from the UK Biobank only, with no overlap with stage 1 samples. In stage 1 we undertook a genome-wide association study of moderate-to-severe asthma, and in stage 2 we followed up independent variants that reached the significance threshold of p less than 1 × 10(-6) in stage 1. We set genome-wide significance at p less than 5 × 10(-8). For novel signals, we investigated their effect on all types of asthma (mild, moderate, and severe). For all signals meeting genome-wide significance, we investigated their effect on gene expression in patients with asthma and controls. We included 5135 cases and 25 675 controls for stage 1, and 5414 cases and 21 471 controls for stage 2. We identified 24 genome-wide significant signals of association with moderate-to-severe asthma, including several signals in innate or adaptive immune-response genes. Three novel signals were identified: rs10905284 in GATA3 (coded allele A, odds ratio [OR] 0·90, 95% CI 0·88-0·93; p=1·76 × 10(-10)), rs11603634 in the MUC5AC region (coded allele G, OR 1·09, 1·06-1·12; p=2·32 × 10(-8)), and rs560026225 near KIAA1109 (coded allele GATT, OR 1·12, 1·08-1·16; p=3·06 × 10(-9)). The MUC5AC signal was not associated with asthma when analyses included mild asthma. The rs11603634 G allele was associated with increased expression of MUC5AC mRNA in bronchial epithelial brush samples via proxy SNP rs11602802; (p=2·50 × 10(-5)) and MUC5AC mRNA was increased in bronchial epithelial samples from patients with severe asthma (in two independent analyses, p=0·039 and p=0·022). We found substantial shared genetic architecture between mild and moderate-to-severe asthma. We also report for the first time genetic variants associated with the risk of developing moderate-to-severe asthma that regulate mucin production. Finally, we identify candidate causal genes in these loci and provide increased insight into this difficult to treat population.

30541042	Agnostic Pathway/Gene Set Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Data Identifies Associations for Pancreatic Cancer.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify associations of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cancer risk but usually only explain a fraction of the inherited variability. Pathway analysis of genetic variants is a powerful tool to identify networks of susceptibility genes. We conducted a large agnostic pathway-based meta-analysis of GWAS data using the summary-based adaptive rank truncated product method to identify gene sets and pathways associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in 9040 cases and 12 496 controls. We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and functional annotation of the top SNPs in genes contributing to the top associated pathways and gene sets. All statistical tests were two-sided. We identified 14 pathways and gene sets associated with PDAC at a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. After Bonferroni correction (P ≤ 1.3 × 10-5), the strongest associations were detected in five pathways and gene sets, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young, regulation of beta-cell development, role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor transactivation by G protein-coupled receptors in cardiac hypertrophy pathways, and the Nikolsky breast cancer chr17q11-q21 amplicon and Pujana ATM Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) network gene sets. We identified and validated rs876493 and three correlating SNPs (PGAP3) and rs3124737 (CASP7) from the Pujana ATM PCC gene set as eQTLs in two normal derived pancreas tissue datasets. Our agnostic pathway and gene set analysis integrated with functional annotation and eQTL analysis provides insight into genes and pathways that may be biologically relevant for risk of PDAC, including those not previously identified.
30552108	Genome-Wide Association Study Confirming a Strong Effect of HLA and Identifying Variants in 	The first genome-wide association study of fulminant type 1 diabetes was performed in Japanese individuals. As previously reported using a candidate gene approach, a strong association was observed with multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA region, and the strongest association was observed with rs9268853 in the class II DR region ((P) = 1.56 × 10(-23), odds ratio [OR] 3.18). In addition, rs11170445 in(CSAD/lnc-ITGB7-1) on chromosome 12q13.13 showed an association at a genome-wide significance level ((P) = 7.58 × 10(-9), OR 1.96). Fine mapping of the region revealed that rs3782151 in(CSAD/lnc-ITGB7-1) showed the lowest(P) value ((P) = 4.60 × 10(-9), OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.57-2.48]). The risk allele of rs3782151 is a(cis) expression quantitative trait locus for(ITGB7) that significantly increases the expression of this gene.(CSAD/lnc-ITGB7-1) was found to be strongly associated with susceptibility to fulminant, but not classical, autoimmune type 1 diabetes, implicating this locus in the distinct phenotype of fulminant type 1 diabetes.
30556296	A case-control genome wide association study of substance use disorder (SUD) identifies novel variants on chromosome 7p14.1 in patients from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).	Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have provided insights into the molecular basis of the disorder in different population. This study presents the first GWAS of substance use disorder (SUD) in patients from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The aim was to identify genetic association(s) that may provide insights into the molecular basis of the disorder. The GWAS discovery cohort consisted of 512 (250 cases and 262 controls) male participants from the UAE. Controls with no prior history of SUD were available from the Emirates family registry. The replication cohort consisted of 520 (415 cases and 105 controls) Australian male Caucasian participants. The GWAS discovery samples were genotyped for 4.6 million single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The replication cohort was genotyped using TaqMan assay. The GWAS association analysis identified three potential SNPs rs118129027 (p-value = 6.24 × 10(-8) ), rs74477937 (p-value = 8.56 × 10(-8) ) and rs78707086 (p-value = 8.55 × 10(-8) ) on ch7p14.1, that did not meet the GWAS significance threshold but were highly suggestive. In the replication cohort, the association of the three top SNPs did not reach statistical significance. In a meta-analysis of the discovery and the replication cohorts, there were no strengthen evidence for association of the three SNPs. The top identified rs118129027 overlaps with a regulatory factor (enhancer) region that targets three neighboring genes LOC105375237, LOC105375240, and YAE1D1. The YAE1D1, which represents a potential locus that is involved in regulating translation initiation pathway. Novel associations that require further confirmation were identified, suggesting a new insight to the genetic basis of SUD.
30557369	Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ovarian cancer in Japanese predicted regulatory variants in 22q13.1.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified greater than 30 variants associated with ovarian cancer, but most of these variants were investigated in European populations. Here, we integrated GWAS and subsequent functional analyses to identify the genetic variants with potential regulatory effects. We conducted GWAS for ovarian cancer using 681 Japanese cases and 17,492 controls and found that rs137672 on 22q13.1 exhibited a strong association with a P-value of 1.05 × 10(-7) and an odds ratio of 0.573 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.466-0.703. In addition, three previously reported SNPs, i.e., rs10088218, rs9870207 and rs1400482, were validated in the Japanese population (P < 0.05) with the same risk allele as noted in previous studies. Functional studies including regulatory feature analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed two regulatory SNPs in 22q13.1, rs2072872 and rs6509, that affect the binding affinity to some nuclear proteins in ovarian cancer cells. The plausible regulatory proteins whose motifs could be affected by the allele changes of these two SNPs were also proposed. Moreover, the protective G allele of rs6509 was associated with a decreased SYNGR1 expression level in normal ovarian tissues. Our findings elucidated the regulatory variants in 22q13.1 that are associated with ovarian cancer risk.
30563984	A case-control genome-wide association study of ADHD discovers a novel association with the tenascin R (TNR) gene.	It is well-established that there is a strong genetic contribution to the aetiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here, we employed a hypothesis-free genome-wide association study (GWAS) design in a sample of 480 clinical childhood ADHD cases and 1208 controls to search for novel genetic risk loci for ADHD. DNA was genotyped using Illumina's Human Infinium PsychArray-24v1.2., and the data were subsequently imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Rigorous quality control and pruning of genotypes at both individual subject and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) levels was performed. Polygenic risk score (PGRS) analysis revealed that ADHD case-control status was explained by genetic risk for ADHD, but no other major psychiatric disorders. Logistic regression analysis was performed genome-wide to test the association between SNPs and ADHD case-control status. We observed a genome-wide significant association (p = 3.15E-08) between ADHD and rs6686722, mapped to the Tenascin R (TNR) gene. Members of this gene family are extracellular matrix glycoproteins that play a role in neural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. Suggestive evidence of associations with ADHD was observed for an additional 111 SNPs (⩽9.91E-05). Although intriguing, the association between DNA variation in the TNR gene and ADHD should be viewed as preliminary given the small sample size of this discovery dataset.
30566433	A variant within the FTO confers susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.	To explore novel genetic loci for diabetic nephropathy, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for diabetic nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. We analyzed the association of 5,768,242 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, 2,380 nephropathy cases and 5,234 controls. We further performed GWAS for diabetic nephropathy using independent Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, 429 cases and 358 controls and the results of these two GWAS were combined with an inverse variance meta-analysis (stage-1), followed by a de novo genotyping for the candidate SNP loci (p < 1.0 × 10(-4)) in an independent case-control study (Stage-2; 1,213 cases and 1,298 controls). After integrating stage-1 and stage-2 data, we identified one SNP locus, significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy; rs56094641 in FTO, P = 7.74 × 10(-10). We further examined the association of rs56094641 with diabetic nephropathy in independent Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (902 cases and 1,221 controls), and found that the association of this locus with diabetic nephropathy remained significant after integrating all association data (P = 7.62 × 10(-10)). We have identified FTO locus as a novel locus for conferring susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
30583798	GWAS Identifies Risk Locus for Erectile Dysfunction and Implicates Hypothalamic Neurobiology and Diabetes in Etiology.	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition affecting more than 20% of men over 60 years, yet little is known about its genetic architecture. We performed a genome-wide association study of ED in 6,175 case subjects among 223,805 European men and identified one locus at 6q16.3 (lead variant rs57989773, OR 1.20 per C-allele; p = 5.71 × 10(-14)), located between MCHR2 and SIM1. In silico analysis suggests SIM1 to confer ED risk through hypothalamic dysregulation. Mendelian randomization provides evidence that genetic risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus is a cause of ED (OR 1.11 per 1-log unit higher risk of type 2 diabetes). These findings provide insights into the biological underpinnings and the causes of ED and may help prioritize the development of future therapies for this common disorder.
30583557	The Alkaline Phosphatase (ALPL) Locus Is Associated with B6 Vitamer Levels in CSF and Plasma.	The active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), is essential for human metabolism. The brain is dependent on vitamin B6 for its neurotransmitter balance. To obtain insight into the genetic determinants of vitamin B6 homeostasis, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the B6 vitamers pyridoxal (PL), PLP and the degradation product of vitamin B6, pyridoxic acid (PA). We collected a unique sample set of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from the same healthy human subjects of Dutch ancestry ((n) = 493) and included concentrations and ratios in and between these body fluids in our analysis. Based on a multivariate joint analysis of all B6 vitamers and their ratios, we identified a genome-wide significant association at a locus on chromosome 1 containing the(ALPL) (alkaline phosphatase) gene (minimal(p) = 7.89 × 10(-10), rs1106357, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.46), previously associated with vitamin B6 levels in blood. Subjects homozygous for the minor allele showed a 1.4-times-higher ratio between PLP and PL in plasma, and even a 1.6-times-higher ratio between PLP and PL in CSF than subjects homozygous for the major allele. In addition, we observed a suggestive association with the CSF:plasma ratio of PLP on chromosome 15 (minimal(p) = 7.93 × 10(-7), and MAF = 0.06 for rs28789220). Even though this finding is not reaching genome-wide significance, it highlights the potential of our experimental setup for studying transport and metabolism across the blood⁻CSF barrier. This GWAS of B6 vitamers identifies alkaline phosphatase as a key regulator in human vitamin B6 metabolism in CSF as well as plasma. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the potential of genetic studies of metabolites in plasma and CSF to elucidate biological aspects underlying metabolite generation, transport and degradation.
30582445	PATJ Low Frequency Variants Are Associated With Worse Ischemic Stroke Functional Outcome.	Ischemic stroke is among the leading causes of adult disability. Part of the variability in functional outcome after stroke has been attributed to genetic factors but no locus has been consistently associated with stroke outcome. Our aim was to identify genetic loci influencing the recovery process using accurate phenotyping to produce the largest GWAS (genome-wide association study) in ischemic stroke recovery to date. A 12-cohort, 2-phase (discovery-replication and joint) meta-analysis of GWAS included anterior-territory and previously independent ischemic stroke cases. Functional outcome was recorded using 3-month modified Rankin Scale. Analyses were adjusted for confounders such as discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. A gene-based burden test was performed. The discovery phase (n=1225) was followed by open (n=2482) and stringent joint-analyses (n=1791). Those cohorts with modified Rankin Scale recorded at time points other than 3-month or incomplete data on previous functional status were excluded in the stringent analyses. Novel variants in PATJ (Pals1-associated tight junction) gene were associated with worse functional outcome at 3-month after stroke. The top variant was rs76221407 (G allele, β=0.40, P=1.70×10(-9)). Our results identify a set of common variants in PATJ gene associated with 3-month functional outcome at genome-wide significance level. Future studies should examine the role of PATJ in stroke recovery and consider stringent phenotyping to enrich the information captured to unveil additional stroke outcome loci.
30621171	Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on Bilirubin Concentrations in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome: Sex-Specific GWAS Analysis and Gene-Diet Interactions in a Mediterranean Population.	Although, for decades, increased serum bilirubin concentrations were considered a threatening sign of underlying liver disease and had been associated with neonatal jaundice, data from recent years show that bilirubin is a powerful antioxidant and suggest that slightly increased serum bilirubin concentrations are protective against oxidative stress-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of the gene-diet interactions in determining serum bilirubin concentrations is needed. None of the previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on bilirubin concentrations has been stratified by sex. Therefore, considering the increasing interest in incorporating the gender perspective into nutritional genomics, our main aim was to carry out a GWAS on total serum bilirubin concentrations in a Mediterranean population with metabolic syndrome, stratified by sex. Our secondary aim was to explore, as a pilot study, the presence of gene-diet interactions at the GWAS level. We included 430 participants (188 men and 242 women, aged 55⁻75 years, and with metabolic syndrome) in the PREDIMED Plus-Valencia study. Global and sex-specific GWAS were undertaken to analyze associations and gene-diet interaction on total serum bilirubin. Adherence (low and high) to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) was analyzed as the dietary modulator. In the GWAS, we detected more than 55 SNPs associated with serum bilirubin at(p) < 5 × 10(-8) (GWAS level). The top-ranked were four SNPs (rs4148325 ((p) = 9.25 × 10(-24)), rs4148324 ((p) = 9.48 × 10(-24)), rs6742078 ((p) = 1.29 × 10(-23)), rs887829 ((p) = 1.39 × 10(-23)), and the rs4148324 ((p) = 9.48 × 10(-24))) in the UGT1A1 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1) gene, which replicated previous findings revealing the UGT1A1 as the major locus. In the sex-specific GWAS, the top-ranked SNPs at the GWAS level were similar in men and women (the lead SNP was the rs4148324-UGT1A1 in both men ((p) = 4.77 × 10(-11)) and women ((p) = 2.15 × 10(-14)), which shows homogeneous genetic results for the major locus. There was more sex-specific heterogeneity for other minor genes associated at the suggestive level of GWAS significance ((p) < 1 × 10(-5)). We did not detect any gene-MedDiet interaction at(p) < 1 × 10(-5) for the major genetic locus, but we detected some gene-MedDiet interactions with other genes at(p) < 1 × 10(-5), and even at the GWAS level for the IL17B gene ((p) = 3.14 × 10(-8)). These interaction results, however, should be interpreted with caution due to our small sample size. In conclusion, our study provides new data, with a gender perspective, on genes associated with total serum bilirubin concentrations in men and women, and suggests possible additional modulations by adherence to MedDiet.
30610198	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and lifetime cannabis use: genetic overlap and causality.	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a severely impairing neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence of 5% in children and adolescents and of 2.5% in adults. Comorbid conditions in ADHD play a key role in symptom progression, disorder course and outcome. ADHD is associated with a significantly increased risk for substance use, abuse and dependence. ADHD and cannabis use are partly determined by genetic factors; the heritability of ADHD is estimated at 70-80% and of cannabis use initiation at 40-48%. In this study, we used summary statistics from the largest available meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADHD (n = 53,293) and lifetime cannabis use (n = 32,330) to gain insights into the genetic overlap and causal relationship of these two traits. We estimated their genetic correlation to be r(2) = 0.29 (P = 1.63 × 10(-5)) and identified four new genome-wide significant loci in a cross-trait analysis: two in a single variant association analysis (rs145108385, P = 3.30 × 10(-8) and rs4259397, P = 4.52 × 10(-8)) and two in a gene-based association analysis (WDPCP, P = 9.67 × 10(-7) and ZNF251, P = 1.62 × 10(-6)). Using a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach we found support that ADHD is causal for lifetime cannabis use, with an odds ratio of 7.9 for cannabis use in individuals with ADHD in comparison to individuals without ADHD (95% CI (3.72, 15.51), P = 5.88 × 10(-5)). These results substantiate the temporal relationship between ADHD and future cannabis use and reinforce the need to consider substance misuse in the context of ADHD in clinical interventions.
30617275	Meta-analysis of up to 622,409 individuals identifies 40 novel smoking behaviour associated genetic loci.	Smoking is a major heritable and modifiable risk factor for many diseases, including cancer, common respiratory disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Fourteen genetic loci have previously been associated with smoking behaviour-related traits. We tested up to 235,116 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on the exome-array for association with smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, pack-years, and smoking cessation in a fixed effects meta-analysis of up to 61 studies (up to 346,813 participants). In a subset of 112,811 participants, a further one million SNVs were also genotyped and tested for association with the four smoking behaviour traits. SNV-trait associations with P < 5 × 10(-8) in either analysis were taken forward for replication in up to 275,596 independent participants from UK Biobank. Lastly, a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication studies was performed. Sixteen SNVs were associated with at least one of the smoking behaviour traits (P < 5 × 10(-8)) in the discovery samples. Ten novel SNVs, including rs12616219 near TMEM182, were followed-up and five of them (rs462779 in REV3L, rs12780116 in CNNM2, rs1190736 in GPR101, rs11539157 in PJA1, and rs12616219 near TMEM182) replicated at a Bonferroni significance threshold (P < 4.5 × 10(-3)) with consistent direction of effect. A further 35 SNVs were associated with smoking behaviour traits in the discovery plus replication meta-analysis (up to 622,409 participants) including a rare SNV, rs150493199, in CCDC141 and two low-frequency SNVs in CEP350 and HDGFRP2. Functional follow-up implied that decreased expression of REV3L may lower the probability of smoking initiation. The novel loci will facilitate understanding the genetic aetiology of smoking behaviour and may lead to the identification of potential drug targets for smoking prevention and/or cessation.
30643196	POGLUT1, the putative effector gene driven by rs2293370 in primary biliary cholangitis susceptibility locus chromosome 3q13.33.	Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic and cholestatic autoimmune liver disease caused by the destruction of intrahepatic small bile ducts. Our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified six susceptibility loci for PBC. Here, in order to further elucidate the genetic architecture of PBC, a GWAS was performed on an additional independent sample set, then a genome-wide meta-analysis with our previous GWAS was performed based on a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) imputation analysis of a total of 4,045 Japanese individuals (2,060 cases and 1,985 healthy controls). A susceptibility locus on chromosome 3q13.33 (including ARHGAP31, TMEM39A, POGLUT1, TIMMDC1, and CD80) was previously identified both in the European and Chinese populations and was replicated in the Japanese population (OR = 0.7241, P = 3.5 × 10(-9)). Subsequent in silico and in vitro functional analyses identified rs2293370, previously reported as the top-hit SNP in this locus in the European population, as the primary functional SNP. Moreover, e-QTL analysis indicated that the effector gene of rs2293370 was Protein O-Glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1) (P = 3.4 × 10(-8)). This is the first study to demonstrate that POGLUT1 and not CD80 is the effector gene regulated by the primary functional SNP rs2293370, and that increased expression of POGLUT1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC.
30649302	Genome-wide association study of anti-Müllerian hormone levels in pre-menopausal women of late reproductive age and relationship with genetic determinants of reproductive lifespan.	Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is required for sexual differentiation in the fetus, and in adult females AMH is produced by growing ovarian follicles. Consequently, AMH levels are correlated with ovarian reserve, declining towards menopause when the oocyte pool is exhausted. A previous genome-wide association study identified three genetic variants in and around the AMH gene that explained 25% of variation in AMH levels in adolescent males but did not identify any genetic associations reaching genome-wide significance in adolescent females. To explore the role of genetic variation in determining AMH levels in women of late reproductive age, we carried out a genome-wide meta-analysis in 3344 pre-menopausal women from five cohorts (median age 44-48 years at blood draw). A single genetic variant, rs16991615, previously associated with age at menopause, reached genome-wide significance at P = 3.48 × 10-10, with a per allele difference in age-adjusted inverse normal AMH of 0.26 standard deviations (SD) (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.18,0.34]). We investigated whether genetic determinants of female reproductive lifespan were more generally associated with pre-menopausal AMH levels. Genetically-predicted age at menarche had no robust association but genetically-predicted age at menopause was associated with lower AMH levels by 0.18 SD (95% CI [0.14,0.21]) in age-adjusted inverse normal AMH per one-year earlier age at menopause. Our findings provide genetic support for the well-established use of AMH as a marker of ovarian reserve.
30647433	A genome-wide association study in individuals of African ancestry reveals the importance of the Duffy-null genotype in the assessment of clozapine-related neutropenia.	Individuals of African ancestry in the United States and Europe are at increased risk of developing schizophrenia and have poorer clinical outcomes. The antipsychotic clozapine, the only licensed medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, is under-prescribed and has high rates of discontinuation in individuals of African ancestry, due in part to increased rates of neutropenia. The genetic basis of lower neutrophil levels in those of African ancestry has not previously been investigated in the context of clozapine treatment. We sought to identify risk alleles in the first genome-wide association study of neutrophil levels during clozapine treatment, in 552 individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and robustly inferred African genetic ancestry. Two genome-wide significant loci were associated with low neutrophil counts during clozapine treatment. The most significantly associated locus was driven by rs2814778 (β = -0.9, P = 4.21 × 10(-21)), a known regulatory variant in the atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1) gene. Individuals homozygous for the C allele at rs2814778 were significantly more likely to develop neutropenia and have to stop clozapine treatment (OR = 20.4, P = 3.44 × 10(-7)). This genotype, also termed "Duffy-null", has previously been shown to be associated with lower neutrophil levels in those of African ancestry. Our results indicate the relevance of the rs2814778 genotype for those taking clozapine and its potential as a pharmacogenetic test, dependent on the outcome of additional safety studies, to assist decision making in the initiation and on-going management of clozapine treatment.
30648747	Anastrozole Aromatase Inhibitor Plasma Drug Concentration Genome-Wide Association Study: Functional Epistatic Interaction Between SLC38A7 and ALPPL2.	Anastrozole is a widely prescribed aromatase inhibitor for the therapy of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for plasma anastrozole concentrations in 687 postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. The top single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signal mapped across SLC38A7 (rs11648166, P = 2.3E-08), which we showed to encode an anastrozole influx transporter. The second most significant signal (rs28845026, P = 5.4E-08) mapped near ALPPL2 and displayed epistasis with the SLC38A7 signal. Both of these SNPs were cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)s for these genes, and patients homozygous for variant genotypes for both SNPs had the highest drug concentrations, the highest SLC38A7 expression, and the lowest ALPPL2 expression. In summary, our GWAS identified a novel gene encoding an anastrozole transporter, SLC38A7, as well as epistatic interaction between SNPs in that gene and SNPs near ALPPL2 that influenced both the expression of the transporter and anastrozole plasma concentrations.
30649180	Association of a Schizophrenia-Risk Nonsynonymous Variant With Putamen Volume in Adolescents: A Voxelwise and Genome-Wide Association Study.	Deviation from normal adolescent brain development precedes manifestations of many major psychiatric symptoms. Such altered developmental trajectories in adolescents may be linked to genetic risk for psychopathology. To identify genetic variants associated with adolescent brain structure and explore psychopathologic relevance of such associations. Voxelwise genome-wide association study in a cohort of healthy adolescents aged 14 years and validation of the findings using 4 independent samples across the life span with allele-specific expression analysis of top hits. Group comparison of the identified gene-brain association among patients with schizophrenia, unaffected siblings, and healthy control individuals. This was a population-based, multicenter study combined with a clinical sample that included participants from the IMAGEN cohort, Saguenay Youth Study, Three-City Study, and Lieber Institute for Brain Development sample cohorts and UK biobank who were assessed for both brain imaging and genetic sequencing. Clinical samples included patients with schizophrenia and unaffected siblings of patients from the Lieber Institute for Brain Development study. Data were analyzed between October 2015 and April 2018. Gray matter volume was assessed by neuroimaging and genetic variants were genotyped by Illumina BeadChip. The discovery sample included 1721 adolescents (873 girls [50.7%]), with a mean (SD) age of 14.44 (0.41) years. The replication samples consisted of 8690 healthy adults (4497 women [51.8%]) from 4 independent studies across the life span. A nonsynonymous genetic variant (minor T allele of rs13107325 in SLC39A8, a gene implicated in schizophrenia) was associated with greater gray matter volume of the putamen (variance explained of 4.21% in the left hemisphere; 8.66; 95% CI, 6.59-10.81; P = 5.35 × 10-18; and 4.44% in the right hemisphere; t = 8.90; 95% CI, 6.75-11.19; P = 6.80 × 10-19) and also with a lower gene expression of SLC39A8 specifically in the putamen (t127 = -3.87; P = 1.70 × 10-4). The identified association was validated in samples across the life span but was significantly weakened in both patients with schizophrenia (z = -3.05; P = .002; n = 157) and unaffected siblings (z = -2.08; P = .04; n = 149). Our results show that a missense mutation in gene SLC39A8 is associated with larger gray matter volume in the putamen and that this association is significantly weakened in schizophrenia. These results may suggest a role for aberrant ion transport in the etiology of psychosis and provide a target for preemptive developmental interventions aimed at restoring the functional effect of this mutation.
30655502	Genetic associations with suicide attempt severity and genetic overlap with major depression.	In 2015, ~800,000 people died by suicide worldwide. For every death by suicide there are as many as 25 suicide attempts, which can result in serious injury even when not fatal. Despite this large impact on morbidity and mortality, the genetic influences on suicide attempt are poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of severity of suicide attempts to investigate genetic influences. A discovery GWAS was performed in Yale-Penn sample cohorts of European Americans (EAs, n = 2,439) and African Americans (AAs, n = 3,881). We found one genome-wide significant (GWS) signal in EAs near the gene LDHB (rs1677091, p = 1.07 × 10(-8)) and three GWS associations in AAs: ARNTL2 on chromosome 12 (rs683813, p = 2.07 × 10(-8)), FAH on chromosome 15 (rs72740082, p = 2.36 × 10(-8)), and on chromosome 18 (rs11876255, p = 4.61 × 10(-8)) in the Yale-Penn discovery sample. We conducted a limited replication analysis in the completely independent Army-STARRS cohorts. rs1677091 replicated in Latinos (LAT, p = 6.52 × 10(-3)). A variant in LD with FAH rs72740082 (rs72740088; r(2) = 0.68) was replicated in AAs (STARRS AA p = 5.23 × 10(-3); AA meta, 1.51 × 10(-9)). When combined for a trans-population meta-analysis, the final sample size included n = 20,153 individuals. Finally, we found significant genetic overlap with major depressive disorder (MDD) using polygenic risk scores from a large GWAS (r(2) = 0.007, p = 6.42 × 10(-5)). To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS of suicide attempt severity. We identified GWS associations near genes involved in anaerobic energy production (LDHB), circadian clock regulation (ARNTL2), and catabolism of tyrosine (FAH). These findings provide evidence of genetic risk factors for suicide attempt severity, providing new information regarding the molecular mechanisms involved.
30659137	Genetic variation in 	To identify novel genetic associations with white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of WMH volumes in 11,226 individuals, including 8,429 population-based individuals from UK Biobank and 2,797 stroke patients. Replication of novel loci was performed in an independent dataset of 1,202 individuals. In all studies, WMH were quantified using validated automated or semi-automated methods. Imputation was to either the Haplotype Reference Consortium or 1,000 Genomes Phase 3 panels. We identified a locus at genome-wide significance in an intron of(PLEKHG1) (rs275350, β [SE] = 0.071 [0.013];(p) = 1.6 × 10(-8)), a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is involved in reorientation of cells in the vascular endothelium. This association was validated in an independent sample (overall(p) value, 2.4 × 10(-9)). The same single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with all ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.07 [1.03-1.12],(p) = 0.00051), most strongly with the small vessel subtype (OR [95% CI] 1.09 [1.00-1.19],(p) = 0.044). Previous associations at 17q25 and 2p16 reached genome-wide significance in this analysis (rs3744020; β [SE] = 0.106 [0.016];(p) = 1.2 × 10(-11) and rs7596872; β [SE] = 0.143 [0.021];(p) = 3.4 × 10(-12)). All identified associations with WMH to date explained 1.16% of the trait variance in UK Biobank, equivalent to 6.4% of the narrow-sense heritability. Genetic variation in(PLEKHG1) is associated with WMH and ischemic stroke, most strongly with the small vessel subtype, suggesting it acts by promoting small vessel arteriopathy.
30659475	A Potential Role for the STXBP5-AS1 Gene in Adult ADHD Symptoms.	We aimed to detect Attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) risk-conferring genes in adults. In children, ADHD is characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity and may persists into adulthood. Childhood and adulthood ADHD are heritable, and are thought to represent the clinical extreme of a continuous distribution of ADHD symptoms in the general population. We aimed to leverage the power of studies of quantitative ADHD symptoms in adults who were genotyped. Within the SAGA (Study of ADHD trait genetics in adults) consortium, we estimated the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of quantitative self-reported ADHD symptoms and carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis in nine adult population-based and case-only cohorts of adults. A total of n = 14,689 individuals were included. In two of the SAGA cohorts we found a significant SNP-based heritability for self-rated ADHD symptom scores of respectively 15% (n = 3656) and 30% (n = 1841). The top hit of the genome-wide meta-analysis (SNP rs12661753; p-value = 3.02 × 10(-7)) was present in the long non-coding RNA gene STXBP5-AS1. This association was also observed in a meta-analysis of childhood ADHD symptom scores in eight population-based pediatric cohorts from the Early Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology (EAGLE) ADHD consortium (n = 14,776). Genome-wide meta-analysis of the SAGA and EAGLE data (n = 29,465) increased the strength of the association with the SNP rs12661753. In human HEK293 cells, expression of STXBP5-AS1 enhanced the expression of a reporter construct of STXBP5, a gene known to be involved in "SNAP" (Soluble NSF attachment protein) Receptor" (SNARE) complex formation. In mouse strains featuring different levels of impulsivity, transcript levels in the prefrontal cortex of the mouse ortholog Gm28905 strongly correlated negatively with motor impulsivity as measured in the five choice serial reaction time task (r(2) = - 0.61; p = 0.004). Our results are consistent with an effect of the STXBP5-AS1 gene on ADHD symptom scores distribution and point to a possible biological mechanism, other than antisense RNA inhibition, involved in ADHD-related impulsivity levels.
30674623	Genetic Determinants of Glycated Hemoglobin in Type 1 Diabetes.	Glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) is an important measure of glycemia in diabetes. HbA(1c) is influenced by environmental and genetic factors both in people with and in people without diabetes. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for HbA(1c) in a Finnish type 1 diabetes (T1D) cohort, FinnDiane. Top results were examined for replication in T1D cohorts DCCT/EDIC, WESDR, CACTI, EDC, and RASS, and a meta-analysis was performed. Three SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 13 near relaxin family peptide receptor 2 ((RXFP2)) were associated with HbA(1c) in FinnDiane at genome-wide significance((P) < 5 × 10(-8)). The minor alleles of rs2085277 and rs1360072 were associated with higher HbA(1c) also in the meta-analysis with RASS((P) < 5 × 10(-8)), where these variants had minor allele frequencies ≥1%. Furthermore, these SNPs were associated with HbA(1c) in an East Asian population without diabetes ((P) ≤ 0.013). A weighted genetic risk score created from 55 HbA(1c)-associated variants from the literature was associated with HbA(1c) in FinnDiane but explained only a small amount of variation. Understanding the genetic basis of glycemic control and HbA(1c) may lead to better prevention of diabetes complications.
30674883	Early-onset autoimmune vitiligo associated with an enhancer variant haplotype that upregulates class II HLA expression.	Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease in which melanocyte destruction causes skin depigmentation, with 49 loci known from previous GWAS. Aiming to define vitiligo subtypes, we discovered that age-of-onset is bimodal; one-third of cases have early onset (mean 10.3 years) and two-thirds later onset (mean 34.0 years). In the early-onset subgroup we found novel association with MHC class II region indel rs145954018, and independent association with the principal MHC class II locus from previous GWAS, represented by rs9271597; greatest association was with rs145954018del-rs9271597A haplotype (P = 2.40 × 10(-86), OR = 8.10). Both rs145954018 and rs9271597 are located within lymphoid-specific enhancers, and the rs145954018del-rs9271597A haplotype is specifically associated with increased expression of HLA-DQB1 mRNA and HLA-DQ protein by monocytes and dendritic cells. Thus, for vitiligo, MHC regulatory variation confers extreme risk, more important than HLA coding variation. MHC regulatory variation may represent a significant component of genetic risk for other autoimmune diseases.
30677029	Genetic architecture of human thinness compared to severe obesity.	The variation in weight within a shared environment is largely attributable to genetic factors. Whilst many genes/loci confer susceptibility to obesity, little is known about the genetic architecture of healthy thinness. Here, we characterise the heritability of thinness which we found was comparable to that of severe obesity (h2 = 28.07 vs 32.33% respectively), although with incomplete genetic overlap (r = -0.49, 95% CI [-0.17, -0.82], p = 0.003). In a genome-wide association analysis of thinness (n = 1,471) vs severe obesity (n = 1,456), we identified 10 loci previously associated with obesity, and demonstrate enrichment for established BMI-associated loci (pbinomial = 3.05x10-5). Simulation analyses showed that different association results between the extremes were likely in agreement with additive effects across the BMI distribution, suggesting different effects on thinness and obesity could be due to their different degrees of extremeness. In further analyses, we detected a novel obesity and BMI-associated locus at PKHD1 (rs2784243, obese vs. thin p = 5.99x10-6, obese vs. controls p = 2.13x10-6 pBMI = 2.3x10-13), associations at loci recently discovered with much larger sample sizes (e.g. FAM150B and PRDM6-CEP120), and novel variants driving associations at previously established signals (e.g. rs205262 at the SNRPC/C6orf106 locus and rs112446794 at the PRDM6-CEP120 locus). Our ability to replicate loci found with much larger sample sizes demonstrates the value of clinical extremes and suggest that characterisation of the genetics of thinness may provide a more nuanced understanding of the genetic architecture of body weight regulation and may inform the identification of potential anti-obesity targets.
30692554	Variants in ABCG8 and TRAF3 genes confer risk for gallstone disease in admixed Latinos with Mapuche Native American ancestry.	Latin Americans and Chilean Amerindians have the highest prevalence of gallstone disease (GSD) and gallbladder cancer (GBC) in the world. A handful of loci have been associated with GSD in populations of predominantly European ancestry, however, they only explain a small portion of the genetic component of the disease. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for GSD in 1,095 admixed Chilean Latinos with Mapuche Native American ancestry. Disease status was assessed by cholecystectomy or abdominal ultrasonography. Top-10 candidate variants surpassing the suggestive cutoff of P < 1 × 10(-5) in the discovery cohort were genotyped in an independent replication sample composed of 1,643 individuals. Variants with positive replication were further examined in two European GSD populations and a Chilean GBC cohort. We consistently replicated the association of ABCG8 gene with GSD (rs11887534, P = 3.24 × 10(-8), OR = 1.74) and identified TRAF3 (rs12882491, P = 1.11 × 10(-7), OR = 1.40) as a novel candidate gene for the disease in admixed Chilean Latinos. ABCG8 and TRAF3 variants also conferred risk to GBC. Gene expression analyses indicated that TRAF3 was significantly decreased in gallbladder (P = 0.015) and duodenal mucosa (P = 0.001) of GSD individuals compared to healthy controls, where according to GTEx data in the small intestine, the presence of the risk allele contributes to the observed effect. We conclude that ABCG8 and TRAF3 genes are associated with GSD and GBC in admixed Latinos and that decreased TRAF3 levels could enhance gallbladder inflammation as is observed in GSD and GSD-associated GBC.
30697902	Genome-wide association study of inhaled corticosteroid response in admixed children with asthma.	Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most widely prescribed and effective medication to control asthma symptoms and exacerbations. However, many children still have asthma exacerbations despite treatment, particularly in admixed populations, such as Puerto Ricans and African Americans. A few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in European and Asian populations, and they have demonstrated the importance of the genetic component in ICS response. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with asthma exacerbations in admixed children treated with ICS and to validate previous GWAS findings. A meta-analysis of two GWAS of asthma exacerbations was performed in 1347 admixed children treated with ICS (Hispanics/Latinos and African Americans), analysing 8.7 million genetic variants. Those with P ≤ 5 × 10(-6) were followed up for replication in 1697 asthmatic patients from six European studies. Associations of ICS response described in published GWAS were followed up for replication in the admixed populations. A total of 15 independent variants were suggestively associated with asthma exacerbations in admixed populations (P ≤ 5 × 10(-6) ). One of them, located in the intergenic region of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C, showed evidence of replication in Europeans (rs5995653, P = 7.52 × 10(-3) ) and was also associated with change in lung function after treatment with ICS (P = 4.91 × 10(-3) ). Additionally, the reported association of the L3MBTL4-ARHGAP28 genomic region was confirmed in admixed populations, although a different variant was identified. This study revealed the novel association of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C with asthma exacerbations in children treated with ICS and replicated previously identified genomic regions. This contributes to the current knowledge about the multiple genetic markers determining responsiveness to ICS which could lead in the future the clinical identification of those asthma patients who are not able to respond to such treatment.
30705256	Genome-wide association study identifies a novel locus associated with psychological distress in the Japanese population.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and disabling psychiatric disorder. A recent mega analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified 44 loci associated with MDD, though most of the genetic etiologies of the MDD/psychological distress remain unclear. To further understand the genetic basis of MDD/psychological distress, we conducted a GWAS in East Asia with more than 10,000 participants of Japanese ancestry who had enrolled in a direct-to-consumer genetic test. After quality control on the genotype data, 10,330 subjects with a total of 8,567,708 imputed SNPs were eligible for the analysis. The participants completed a self-administered questionnaire on their past medical history and health conditions that included the 6-item Kessler screening scale (K6 scale) for psychological distress (cut-off point of 5) and past medical history of MDD, resulting in 3981 subjects assigned to "psychologically distressed group" [cases], and the remaining 6349 subjects were assigned to the "non-psychologically distressed group" [controls]. In this GWAS, we found an association with genome-wide significance at rs6073833 (P = 7.60 × 10(-9)) in 20q13.12. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale GWAS for psychological distress using data from direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests in a population of non-European-ancestry, and the present study thus detected a novel locus significantly associated with psychological distress in the Japanese population.
30706531	Variation in SIPA1L2 is correlated with phenotype modification in Charcot- Marie- Tooth disease type 1A.	Genetic modifiers in rare disease have long been suspected to contribute to the considerable variance in disease expression, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). To address this question, the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium collected a large standardized sample of such rare CMT1A patients over a period of 8 years. CMT1A is caused in most patients by a uniformly sized 1.5 Mb duplication event involving the gene PMP22. We genotyped DNA samples from 971 CMT1A patients on Illumina BeadChips. Genome-wide analysis was performed in a subset of 330 of these patients, who expressed the extremes of a hallmark symptom: mild and severe foot dorsiflexion strength impairment. SIPA1L2 (signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 like 2), the top identified candidate modifier gene, was expressed in the peripheral nerve, and our functional studies identified and confirmed interacting proteins using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, mass spectrometry, and immunocytochemistry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vitro siRNA experiments were used to analyze gene regulation. We identified significant association of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10910527, rs7536385, rs4649265, rs1547740) in SIPA1L2 with foot dorsiflexion strength (p < 1 × 10(-7) ). Coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy studies identified β-actin and MYH9 as SIPA1L2 binding partners. Furthermore, we show that SIPA1L2 is part of a myelination-associated coexpressed network regulated by the master transcription factor SOX10. Importantly, in vitro knockdown of SIPA1L2 in Schwannoma cells led to a significant reduction of PMP22 expression, hinting at a potential strategy for drug development. SIPA1L2 is a potential genetic modifier of CMT1A phenotypic expressions and offers a new pathway to therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:316-330.
30704525	A genome-wide association study of mitochondrial DNA copy number in two population-based cohorts.	Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA CN) exhibits interindividual and intercellular variation, but few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of directly assayed mtDNA CN exist. We undertook a GWAS of qPCR-assayed mtDNA CN in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the UK Blood Service (UKBS) cohort. After validating and harmonising data, 5461 ALSPAC mothers (16-43 years at mtDNA CN assay) and 1338 UKBS females (17-69 years) were included in a meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses restricted to females with white cell-extracted DNA and adjusted for estimated or assayed cell proportions. Associations were also explored in ALSPAC children and UKBS males. A neutrophil-associated locus approached genome-wide significance (rs709591 [MED24], β (change in SD units of mtDNA CN per allele) [SE] - 0.084 [0.016], p = 1.54e-07) in the main meta-analysis of adult females. This association was concordant in magnitude and direction in UKBS males and ALSPAC neonates. SNPs in and around ABHD8 were associated with mtDNA CN in ALSPAC neonates (rs10424198, β [SE] 0.262 [0.034], p = 1.40e-14), but not other study groups. In a meta-analysis of unrelated individuals (N = 11,253), we replicated a published association in TFAM (β [SE] 0.046 [0.017], p = 0.006), with an effect size much smaller than that observed in the replication analysis of a previous in silico GWAS. In a hypothesis-generating GWAS, we confirm an association between TFAM and mtDNA CN and present putative loci requiring replication in much larger samples. We discuss the limitations of our work, in terms of measurement error and cellular heterogeneity, and highlight the need for larger studies to better understand nuclear genomic control of mtDNA copy number.
30718454	Genome-wide by environment interaction studies of depressive symptoms and psychosocial stress in UK Biobank and Generation Scotland.	Stress is associated with poorer physical and mental health. To improve our understanding of this link, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of depressive symptoms and genome-wide by environment interaction studies (GWEIS) of depressive symptoms and stressful life events (SLE) in two UK population-based cohorts (Generation Scotland and UK Biobank). No SNP was individually significant in either GWAS, but gene-based tests identified six genes associated with depressive symptoms in UK Biobank (DCC, ACSS3, DRD2, STAG1, FOXP2 and KYNU; p < 2.77 × 10(-6)). Two SNPs with genome-wide significant GxE effects were identified by GWEIS in Generation Scotland: rs12789145 (53-kb downstream PIWIL4; p = 4.95 × 10(-9); total SLE) and rs17070072 (intronic to ZCCHC2; p = 1.46 × 10(-8); dependent SLE). A third locus upstream CYLC2 (rs12000047 and rs12005200, p < 2.00 × 10(-8); dependent SLE) when the joint effect of the SNP main and GxE effects was considered. GWEIS gene-based tests identified: MTNR1B with GxE effect with dependent SLE in Generation Scotland; and PHF2 with the joint effect in UK Biobank (p < 2.77 × 10(-6)). Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) analyses incorporating GxE effects improved the prediction of depressive symptom scores, when using weights derived from either the UK Biobank GWAS of depressive symptoms (p = 0.01) or the PGC GWAS of major depressive disorder (p = 5.91 × 10(-3)). Using an independent sample, PRS derived using GWEIS GxE effects provided evidence of shared aetiologies between depressive symptoms and schizotypal personality, heart disease and COPD. Further such studies are required and may result in improved treatments for depression and other stress-related conditions.
30718733	The Korea Biobank Array: Design and Identification of Coding Variants Associated with Blood Biochemical Traits.	We introduce the design and implementation of a new array, the Korea Biobank Array (referred to as KoreanChip), optimized for the Korean population and demonstrate findings from GWAS of blood biochemical traits. KoreanChip comprised >833,000 markers including >247,000 rare-frequency or functional variants estimated from >2,500 sequencing data in Koreans. Of the 833 K markers, 208 K functional markers were directly genotyped. Particularly, >89 K markers were presented in East Asians. KoreanChip achieved higher imputation performance owing to the excellent genomic coverage of 95.38% for common and 73.65% for low-frequency variants. From GWAS (Genome-wide association study) using 6,949 individuals, 28 associations were successfully recapitulated. Moreover, 9 missense variants were newly identified, of which we identified new associations between a common population-specific missense variant, rs671 (p.Glu457Lys) of ALDH2, and two traits including aspartate aminotransferase (P = 5.20 × 10(-13)) and alanine aminotransferase (P = 4.98 × 10(-8)). Furthermore, two novel missense variants of GPT with rare frequency in East Asians but extreme rarity in other populations were associated with alanine aminotransferase (rs200088103; p.Arg133Trp, P = 2.02 × 10(-9) and rs748547625; p.Arg143Cys, P = 1.41 × 10(-6)). These variants were successfully replicated in 6,000 individuals (P = 5.30 × 10(-8) and P = 1.24 × 10(-6)). GWAS results suggest the promising utility of KoreanChip with a substantial number of damaging variants to identify new population-specific disease-associated rare/functional variants.
30718321	Genome-Wide Association Studies of Impulsive Personality Traits (BIS-11 and UPPS-P) and Drug Experimentation in up to 22,861 Adult Research Participants Identify Loci in the 	Impulsive personality traits are complex heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly drug abuse and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In collaboration with the genetics company 23andMe, we performed 10 genome-wide association studies on measures of impulsive personality traits [the short version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)] and drug experimentation (the number of drug classes an individual had tried in their lifetime) in up to 22,861 male and female adult human research participants of European ancestry. Impulsive personality traits and drug experimentation showed single nucleotide polymorphism heritabilities that ranged from 5 to 11%. Genetic variants in the(CADM2) locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Sensation Seeking ((p) = 8.3 × 10(-9), rs139528938) and showed a suggestive association with Drug Experimentation ((p) = 3.0 × 10(-7), rs2163971;(r)(2) = 0.68 with rs139528938). Furthermore, genetic variants in the(CACNA1I) locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Negative Urgency ((p) = 3.8 × 10(-8); rs199694726). The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. Multiple subscales from both UPPS-P and BIS showed strong genetic correlations (>0.5) with Drug Experimentation and other substance use traits measured in independent cohorts, including smoking initiation, and lifetime cannabis use. Several UPPS-P and BIS subscales were genetically correlated with ADHD ((r)(g) = 0.30-0.51), supporting their validity as endophenotypes. Our findings demonstrate a role for common genetic contributions to individual differences in impulsivity. Furthermore, our study is the first to provide a genetic dissection of the relationship between different types of impulsive personality traits and various psychiatric disorders.(SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT) Impulsive personality traits (IPTs) are heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly substance use disorders. We have performed genome-wide association studies of IPTs to identify regions and genes that account for this heritable variation. IPTs and drug experimentation were modestly heritable (5-11%). We identified an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in(CADM2) and both sensation seeking and drug experimentation; and between variants in(CACNA1I) and negative urgency. The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. This study provides evidence that impulsivity can be genetically separated into distinct components. We showed that IPT are genetically associated with substance use and ADHD, suggesting impulsivity is an endophenotype contributing to these psychiatric conditions.
30714141	Two novel genetic variants in the STK38L and RAB27A genes are associated with glioma susceptibility.	Glioma is the most common malignant primary brain tumors with poor prognosis. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of glioma in populations with Western European ancestry were completed in the US and UK. However, our previous results strongly suggest the genetic heterogeneity could be important in glioma risk. To systematically investigate glioma risk-associated variants in Chinese population, we performed a multistage GWAS of glioma in the Han Chinese population, with a total of 3,097 glioma cases and 4,362 controls. In addition to confirming two associations reported in other ancestry groups, this study identified one new risk-associated locus for glioma on chromosome 12p11.23 (rs10842893, p(meta) = 2.33x10-12, STK38L) as well as a promising association at 15q15-21.1 (rs4774756, p(meta) = 6.12x10-8, RAB27A) in 3,097 glioma cases and 4,362 controls. Our findings demonstrate two novel association between the glioma risk region marked by variant rs10842893 and rs4774756) and glioma risk. These findings may advance the understanding of genetic susceptibility to glioma.
30738427	A genome-wide association study identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with time-to-metastasis in colorectal cancer.	Differentiating between cancer patients who will experience metastasis within a short time and who will be long-term survivors without metastasis is a critical aim in healthcare. The microsatellite instability (MSI)-high tumor phenotype is such a differentiator in colorectal cancer, as patients with these tumors are unlikely to experience metastasis. Our aim in this study was to determine if germline genetic variations could further differentiate colorectal cancer patients based on the long-term risk and timing of metastasis. The patient cohort consisted of 379 stage I-III Caucasian colorectal cancer patients with microsatellite stable or MSI-low tumors. We performed univariable analysis on 810,622 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) under different genetic models. Depending on the long-term metastasis-free survival probability estimates, we applied a mixture cure model, Cox proportional hazards regression model, or log-rank test. For SNPs reaching Bonferroni-corrected significance (p < 6.2 × 10(- 8)) having valid genetic models, multivariable analysis adjusting for significant baseline characteristics was conducted. After adjusting for significant baseline characteristics, specific genotypes of ten polymorphisms were significantly associated with time-to-metastasis. These polymorphisms are three intergenic SNPs, rs5749032 (p = 1.28 × 10(- 10)), rs2327990 (p = 9.59 × 10(- 10)), rs1145724 (p = 3 × 10(- 8)), and seven SNPs within the non-coding sequences of three genes: FHIT (p = 2.59 × 10(- 9)), EPHB1 (p = 8.23 × 10(- 9)), and MIR7515 (p = 4.87 × 10(- 8)). Our results suggest novel associations of specific genotypes of SNPs with early metastasis in Caucasian colorectal cancer patients. These associations, once replicated in other patient cohorts, could assist in the development of personalized treatment strategies for colorectal cancer patients.
30741946	Genome-wide association scan identifies new variants associated with a cognitive predictor of dyslexia.	Developmental dyslexia (DD) is one of the most prevalent learning disorders, with high impact on school and psychosocial development and high comorbidity with conditions like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety. DD is characterized by deficits in different cognitive skills, including word reading, spelling, rapid naming, and phonology. To investigate the genetic basis of DD, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of these skills within one of the largest studies available, including nine cohorts of reading-impaired and typically developing children of European ancestry (N = 2562-3468). We observed a genome-wide significant effect (p < 1 × 10(-8)) on rapid automatized naming of letters (RANlet) for variants on 18q12.2, within MIR924HG (micro-RNA 924 host gene; rs17663182 p = 4.73 × 10(-9)), and a suggestive association on 8q12.3 within NKAIN3 (encoding a cation transporter; rs16928927, p = 2.25 × 10(-8)). rs17663182 (18q12.2) also showed genome-wide significant multivariate associations with RAN measures (p = 1.15 × 10(-8)) and with all the cognitive traits tested (p = 3.07 × 10(-8)), suggesting (relational) pleiotropic effects of this variant. A polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis revealed significant genetic overlaps of some of the DD-related traits with educational attainment (EDUyears) and ADHD. Reading and spelling abilities were positively associated with EDUyears (p ~ [10(-5)-10(-7)]) and negatively associated with ADHD PRS (p ~ [10(-8)-10(-17)]). This corroborates a long-standing hypothesis on the partly shared genetic etiology of DD and ADHD, at the genome-wide level. Our findings suggest new candidate DD susceptibility genes and provide new insights into the genetics of dyslexia and its comorbities.
30760885	Biological insights into multiple birth: genetic findings from UK Biobank.	The tendency to conceive spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twins is a complex trait with important contributions from both environmental factors and genetic disposition. In earlier work, we identified the first two genes as maternal susceptibility loci for DZ twinning. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants influencing multiple births and to genetically correlate the findings across a broad range of traits. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8962 participants with Caucasian ancestry from UK Biobank who reported being part of a multiple birth, and 409,591 singleton controls. We replicated the association between FSHB, SMAD3 and twinning in the gene-based (but not SNP-based) test, which had been established in previous genome-wide association analyses in mothers with dizygotic twin offspring. Additionally, we report a novel genetic variant associated with multiple birth, rs428022 at 15q23 (p = 2.84 × 10(-8)) close to two genes: PIAS1 and SKOR1. Finally, we identified meaningful genetic correlations between being part of a multiple birth and other phenotypes (anthropometric traits, health-related traits, and fertility-related measures). The outcomes of this study provide important new insights into the genetic aetiology of multiple births and fertility, and open up novel directions for fertility and reproduction research.
30787463	Genome-wide association study of germline variants and breast cancer-specific mortality.	We examined the associations between germline variants and breast cancer mortality using a large meta-analysis of women of European ancestry. Meta-analyses included summary estimates based on Cox models of twelve datasets using ~10.4 million variants for 96,661 women with breast cancer and 7697 events (breast cancer-specific deaths). Oestrogen receptor (ER)-specific analyses were based on 64,171 ER-positive (4116) and 16,172 ER-negative (2125) patients. We evaluated the probability of a signal to be a true positive using the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP). We did not find any variant associated with breast cancer-specific mortality at P < 5 × 10(-8). For ER-positive disease, the most significantly associated variant was chr7:rs4717568 (BFDP = 7%, P = 1.28 × 10(-7), hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.92); the closest gene is AUTS2. For ER-negative disease, the most significant variant was chr7:rs67918676 (BFDP = 11%, P = 1.38 × 10(-7), HR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.16-1.39); located within a long intergenic non-coding RNA gene (AC004009.3), close to the HOXA gene cluster. We uncovered germline variants on chromosome 7 at BFDP < 15% close to genes for which there is biological evidence related to breast cancer outcome. However, the paucity of variants associated with mortality at genome-wide significance underpins the challenge in providing genetic-based individualised prognostic information for breast cancer patients.
30796134	Genome-wide association meta-analysis of functional outcome after ischemic stroke.	To discover common genetic variants associated with poststroke outcomes using a genome-wide association (GWA) study. The study comprised 6,165 patients with ischemic stroke from 12 studies in Europe, the United States, and Australia included in the GISCOME (Genetics of Ischaemic Stroke Functional Outcome) network. The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score after 60 to 190 days, evaluated as 2 dichotomous variables (0-2 vs 3-6 and 0-1 vs 2-6) and subsequently as an ordinal variable. GWA analyses were performed in each study independently and results were meta-analyzed. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, stroke severity (baseline NIH Stroke Scale score), and ancestry. The significance level was(p) < 5 × 10(-8). We identified one genetic variant associated with functional outcome with genome-wide significance (modified Rankin Scale scores 0-2 vs 3-6,(p) = 5.3 × 10(-9)). This intronic variant (rs1842681) in the(LOC105372028) gene is a previously reported trans-expression quantitative trait locus for(PPP1R21), which encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1. This ubiquitous phosphatase is implicated in brain functions such as brain plasticity. Several variants detected in this study demonstrated suggestive association with outcome ((p) < 10(-5)), some of which are within or near genes with experimental evidence of influence on ischemic stroke volume and/or brain recovery (e.g.,(NTN4),(TEK), and(PTCH1)). In this large GWA study on functional outcome after ischemic stroke, we report one significant variant and several variants with suggestive association to outcome 3 months after stroke onset with plausible mechanistic links to poststroke recovery. Future replication studies and exploration of potential functional mechanisms for identified genetic variants are warranted.
30823506	Genomic Variations in Susceptibility to Intracranial Aneurysm in the Korean Population.	Genome-wide association studies found genetic variations with modulatory effects for intracranial aneurysm (IA) formations in European and Japanese populations. We aimed to identify the susceptibility of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to IA in a Korean population consisting of 250 patients, and 294 controls using the Asian-specific Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array. Twenty-nine SNPs reached a genome-wide significance threshold (5 × 10(-8)). The rs371331393 SNP, with a stop-gain function of(ARHGAP32) (11q24.3), showed the most significant association with the risk of IA (OR = 43.57, 95% CI: 21.84⁻86.95;(p) = 9.3 × 10(-27)). Eight out of 29 SNPs-(GBA) (rs75822236),(TCF24) (rs112859779),(OLFML2A) (rs79134766),(ARHGAP32) (rs371331393),(CD163L1) (rs138525217),(CUL4A) (rs74115822),(LOC102724084) (rs75861150), and(LRRC3) (rs116969723)-demonstrated sufficient statistical power greater than or equal to 0.8. Two previously reported SNPs, rs700651 ((BOLL), 2q33.1) and rs6841581 ((EDNRA), 4q31.22), were validated in our GWAS (Genome-wide association study). In a subsequent analysis, three SNPs showed a significant difference in expressions: the rs6741819 ((RNF144A), 2p25.1) was down-regulated in the adrenal gland tissue ((p) = 1.5 × 10(-6)), the rs1052270 ((TMOD1). 9q22.33) was up-regulated in the testis tissue ((p) = 8.6 × 10(-10)), and rs6841581 ((EDNRA), 4q31.22) was up-regulated in both the esophagus ((p) = 5.2 × 10(-12)) and skin tissues (1.2 × 10(-6)). Our GWAS showed novel candidate genes with Korean-specific variations in IA formations. Large population based studies are thus warranted.
30808802	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies genetic locus on chromosome 9 associated with Modic changes.	Low back pain (LBP) is a common disabling condition. Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) may be a contributing factor for LBP. Modic change (MC), a distinct phenotype of LDD, is presented as a pathological bone marrow signal change adjacent to vertebral endplate on MRI. It is strongly associated with LBP and has heritability around 30%. Our objective was to identify genetic loci associated with MC using a genome-wide meta-analysis. Presence of MC was evaluated in lumbar MRI in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (n=1182) and TwinsUK (n=647). Genome-wide association analyses were carried out using linear regression model. Inverse-variance weighting approach was used in the meta-analysis. A locus associated with MC (p<5e-8) was found on chromosome 9 with the lead SNP rs1934268 in an intron of the(PTPRD) gene. It is located in the binding region of BCL11A, SPI1 and PBX3 transcription factors. The SNP was nominally associated with LBP in TwinsUK (p=0.001) but not associated in the UK Biobank (p=0.914). Suggestive signals (p<1e-5) were identified near(XKR4),(SCIN),(MGMT),(DLG2),(ZNF184) and(OPRK1).(PTPRD) is a novel candidate gene for MC that may act via the development of cartilage or nervous system; further work is needed to define the mechanisms underlying the pathways leading to development of MC. This is the first genome-wide meta-analysis of MC, and the results pave the way for further studies on the genetic factors underlying the various features of spine degeneration and LBP.
30809046	Genome-wide association study suggests impact of chromosome 10 rs139401390 on kidney function in patients with coronary artery disease.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for onset and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). Discovery of predisposing loci for kidney function in CAD patients was performed using a genome-wide association approach. Inclusion criteria were CAD with ≥50% stenosis (≥1 coronary artery) and a creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30-75 ml/min/1.73 m(2). An association of rs139401390 located to a region 58.8 kb upstream of renalase (RNLS) with eGFR was detected in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study (n = 499, p = 7.88 × 10(-9), mean eGFR 60.7 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Direct genotyping of rs139401390A > G suggested increased eGFR by 12.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) per A allele (p = 0.000004). Genome-wide replication of rs139401390A > G in the Coronary Artery Disease and Renal Failure (CAD-REF) registry with a mean eGFR of 47.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 574, p = 0.033) was only nominally significant. Comparison of rs139401390 genotypes for risk of reduced kidney function in the overall LURIC study revealed higher adjusted odds ratios (OR) for eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) for CAD patients (n = 1992, OR = 2.36, p = 0.008, G/A + G/G vs A/A) compared to patients with/without CAD (n = 2908, OR = 1.97, p = 0.014, G/A + G/G vs A/A). No significant risk elevation was detected in patients without CAD (n = 948, p = 0.571). rs139401390 may affect kidney function in CAD patients with mild reduction in eGFR.
30824882	Genome-wide association meta-analysis for total thyroid hormone levels in Croatian population.	Thyroid hormones (THs) are key regulators of cellular growth, development, and metabolism. The thyroid gland secretes two THs, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), into the plasma where they are almost all bound reversibly to plasma proteins. Free forms of THs are metabolically active, however, they represent a very small fraction of total TH levels. No genome-wide studies have been performed to date on total TH levels, comprising of protein-bound and free forms of THs. To detect genetic variants associated with total TH levels, we carried out the first GWAS meta-analysis of total T4 levels in 1121 individuals from two Croatian cohorts (Split and Korcula). We also performed GWAS analyses of total T3 levels in 577 individuals and T3/T4 ratio in 571 individuals from the Split cohort. The top association in GWAS meta-analysis of total T4 was detected for an intronic variant within SLC22A9 gene (rs12282281, P = 4.00 × 10(-7)). Within the same region, a genome-wide significant variant (rs11822642, P = 2.50 × 10(-8)) for the T3/T4 ratio was identified. SLC22A9 encodes for an organic anion transporter protein expressed predominantly in the liver and belongs to the superfamily of solute carriers (SLC), a large group of transport membrane proteins. The transport of THs across the plasma membrane in peripheral tissues is facilitated by the membrane proteins, and all TH transport proteins known to date belong to the same SLC superfamily as SLC22A9. These results suggest a potential role for SLC22A9 as a novel transporter protein of THs.
30837455	Genome wide analysis for mouth ulcers identifies associations at immune regulatory loci.	Mouth ulcers are the most common ulcerative condition and encompass several clinical diagnoses, including recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Despite previous evidence for heritability, it is not clear which specific genetic loci are implicated in RAS. In this genome-wide association study (n = 461,106) heritability is estimated at 8.2% (95% CI: 6.4%, 9.9%). This study finds 97 variants which alter the odds of developing non-specific mouth ulcers and replicate these in an independent cohort (n = 355,744) (lead variant after meta-analysis: rs76830965, near IL12A, OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.73); P = 4.4e-483). Additional effect estimates from three independent cohorts with more specific phenotyping and specific study characteristics support many of these findings. In silico functional analyses provide evidence for a role of T cell regulation in the aetiology of mouth ulcers. These results provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of a common, important condition.
30843173	Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel loci associated with free triiodothyronine and thyroid-stimulating hormone.	Thyroid hormones are essential for the normal function of almost all human tissues, and have critical roles in metabolism, differentiation and growth. Free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are under strong genetic influence; however, most of the heritability is yet unexplained. In order to identify novel loci associated with fT3, fT4 and TSH serum levels we performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of 7 411 206 polymorphisms in up to 1731 euthyroid individuals from three Croatian cohorts from Dalmatia region: two genetically isolated island populations and one mainland population. Additionally, we also performed a bivariate analysis of fT3 and fT4 levels. The EPHB2 gene variant rs67142165 reached genome-wide significance for association with fT3 plasma levels (P = 9.27 × 10(-9)) and its significance was confirmed in bivariate analysis (P = 9.72 × 10(-9)). We also found a genome-wide significant association for variant rs13037502 upstream of the PTPN1 gene and TSH plasma levels (P = 1.67 × 10(-8)). We identified a first genome-wide significant variant associated with fT3 plasma levels, as well as a novel locus associated with TSH plasma levels. These findings are biologically relevant and enrich our knowledge about the genetic basis of pituitary-thyroid axis function.
30866520	Circulating Chemerin Levels, but not the 	Chemerin, a novel adipokine, has been associated with metabolic, inflammatory, and atherosclerotic diseases. We aimed to determine the genetic basis of chemerin levels by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to investigate the role of(RARRES2) polymorphisms and circulating chemerin levels in the long-term outcome of coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 2197 participants from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) were recruited for the GWAS analysis, and 481 patients with angiographically confirmed CAD were enrolled for long-term outcome analysis. One locus of genome-wide significance with a single independent association signal was identified in the GWAS for chemerin levels with the peak association at the(RARRES2) gene promoter region polymorphism rs3735167 ((p) = 2.35 × 10(-21)). In the CAD population, borderline significance was noted between(RARRES2) polymorphisms and chemerin levels, whereas high chemerin levels were associated with obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, current smoking, high platelet and leukocyte counts, anemia, impaired renal function, high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and multi-vessel disease. Kaplan⁻Meier survival curves indicated that the patients with high chemerin and CRP levels, but not those with(RARRES2) polymorphisms, had a lower survival rate and higher combined cerebral and cardiovascular event rates. Combined chemerin and CRP levels further revealed a stepwise increase in poor clinical outcomes from low- to high-risk subgroups. In conclusion, rs3735167 is the lead(RARRES2) polymorphism for chemerin levels in Taiwanese. Chemerin levels, but not the rs3735167 genotypes, predicted the long-term outcome of CAD, especially when combined with CRP levels.
30852652	The metabolic network coherence of human transcriptomes is associated with genetic variation at the cadherin 18 locus.	Metabolic coherence (MC) is a network-based approach to dimensionality reduction that can be used, for example, to interpret the joint expression of genes linked to human metabolism. Computationally, the derivation of 'transcriptomic' MC involves mapping of an individual gene expression profile onto a gene-centric network derived beforehand from a metabolic network (currently Recon2), followed by the determination of the connectivity of a particular, profile-specific subnetwork. The biological significance of MC has been exemplified previously in the context of human inflammatory bowel disease, among others, but the genetic architecture of this quantitative cellular trait is still unclear. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MC in the 1000 Genomes/ GEUVADIS data (n = 457) and identified a solitary genome-wide significant association with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the intronic region of the cadherin 18 (CDH18) gene on chromosome 5 (lead SNP: rs11744487, p = 1.2 × 10(- 8)). Cadherin 18 is a transmembrane protein involved in human neural development and cell-to-cell signaling. Notably, genetic variation at the CDH18 locus has been associated with metabolic syndrome-related traits before. Replication of our genome-wide significant GWAS result was successful in another population study from the Netherlands (BIOS, n = 2661; lead SNP), but failed in two additional studies (KORA, Germany, n = 711; GENOA, USA, n = 411). Besides sample size issues, we surmise that these discrepant findings may be attributable to technical differences. While 1000 Genomes/GEUVADIS and BIOS gene expression profiles were generated by RNA sequencing, the KORA and GENOA data were microarray-based. In addition to providing first evidence for a link between regional genetic variation and a metabolism-related characteristic of human transcriptomes, our findings highlight the benefit of adopting a systems biology-oriented approach to molecular data analysis.
30854688	Genome-wide Association Studies of Specific Antinuclear Autoantibody Subphenotypes in Primary Biliary Cholangitis.	Anti-nuclear antibodies to speckled 100 kDa (sp100) and glycoprotein 210 (gp210) are specific serologic markers of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) of uncertain/controversial clinical or prognostic significance. To study the genetic determinants associated with sp100 and gp210 autoantibody subphenotypes, we performed a genome-wide association analysis of 930 PBC cases based on their autoantibody status, followed by a replication study in 1,252 PBC cases. We confirmed single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs492899 (P = 3.27 × 10(-22) ; odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.34-3.66) and rs1794280 (P = 5.78 × 10(-28) ; OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 3.05-4.96) in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region associated with the sp100 autoantibody. However, no genetic variant was identified as being associated with the gp210 autoantibody. To further define specific classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles or amino acids associated with the sp100 autoantibody, we imputed 922 PBC cases (211 anti-sp100-positive versus 711 negative cases) using a Han Chinese MHC reference database. Conditional analysis identified that HLA-DRβ1-Asn77/Arg74, DRβ1-Ser37, and DPβ1-Lys65 were major determinants for sp100 production. For the classical HLA alleles, the strongest association was with DRB1*03:01 (P = 1.51 × 10(-9) ; OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.06-4.29). Regression analysis with classical HLA alleles identified DRB1*03:01, DRB1*15:01, DRB1*01, and DPB1*03:01 alleles can explain most of the HLA association with sp100 autoantibody. Conclusion: This study indicated significant genetic predisposition to the sp100 autoantibody, but not the gp210 autoantibody, subphenotype in PBC patients. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if these findings have clinical significance to PBC pathogenesis and/or therapeutics.
30889042	An initial genetic analysis of gemcitabine-induced high-grade neutropenia in pancreatic cancer patients in CALGB 80303 (Alliance).	One of the standard of care regimens for advanced pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. The efficacy of gemcitabine is limited by dose-limiting hematologic toxicities especially neutropenia. Uncovering the variability of these toxicities attributed to germline DNA variation is of great importance. CALGB 80303 was a randomized study in advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine with or without bevacizumab. The study protocol included genotyping of genes of gemcitabine disposition (CDA, DCTD, SLC29A1, SLC28A1, and SLC29A2), as well as a genome-wide analysis. The clinical phenotype was time to early high-grade neutropenia event accounting for progression or death or other treatment-terminating adverse events as competing for informative events. The inference was carried out on the basis of the association between genotype and cause-specific hazard of a neutropenic event. The primary analyses were carried out on the basis of 294 genetically estimated European pancreatic cancer patients. For CDA rs2072671 (A>C), AC and CC patients had a lower risk of neutropenia than AA patients (P=0.01, hazard ratio: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.89). For SLC28A1 rs3825876 (G>A), AA patients have a higher risk of neutropenia than GA and GG patients (P=0.02, hazard ratio: 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.16). CDA rs2072671 was associated with increased mRNA expression in whole blood in three studies (P=2.7e-14, 6.61e-62, and 9.70e-65). In the genome-wide analysis, variants in TGFB2 were among the top hits (lowest P=1.62e-06) but had no effect in luciferase assays. This is the first genetic analysis of gemcitabine-induced neutropenia using a competing risk model in a prospective randomized clinical study has proposed a potentially novel mechanism of the protective effect of the CDA rs2072671 variant. Further confirmation is needed.
30888730	Meta-Analysis of Genomewide Association Studies Reveals Genetic Variants for Hip Bone Geometry.	Hip geometry is an important predictor of fracture. We performed a meta-analysis of GWAS studies in adults to identify genetic variants that are associated with proximal femur geometry phenotypes. We analyzed four phenotypes: (i) femoral neck length; (ii) neck-shaft angle; (iii) femoral neck width, and (iv) femoral neck section modulus, estimated from DXA scans using algorithms of hip structure analysis. In the Discovery stage, 10 cohort studies were included in the fixed-effect meta-analysis, with up to 18,719 men and women ages 16 to 93 years. Association analyses were performed with ∼2.5 million polymorphisms under an additive model adjusted for age, body mass index, and height. Replication analyses of meta-GWAS significant loci (at adjusted genomewide significance [GWS], threshold p ≤ 2.6 × 10(-8) ) were performed in seven additional cohorts in silico. We looked up SNPs associated in our analysis, for association with height, bone mineral density (BMD), and fracture. In meta-analysis (combined Discovery and Replication stages), GWS associations were found at 5p15 (IRX1 and ADAMTS16); 5q35 near FGFR4; at 12p11 (in CCDC91); 11q13 (near LRP5 and PPP6R3 (rs7102273)). Several hip geometry signals overlapped with BMD, including LRP5 (chr. 11). Chr. 11 SNP rs7102273 was associated with any-type fracture (p = 7.5 × 10(-5) ). We used bone transcriptome data and discovered several significant eQTLs, including rs7102273 and PPP6R3 expression (p = 0.0007), and rs6556301 (intergenic, chr.5 near FGFR4) and PDLIM7 expression (p = 0.005). In conclusion, we found associations between several genes and hip geometry measures that explained 12% to 22% of heritability at different sites. The results provide a defined set of genes related to biological pathways relevant to BMD and etiology of bone fragility. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
30898391	Genome-wide association studies identify susceptibility loci for epithelial ovarian cancer in east Asian women.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have focused largely on populations of European ancestry. We aimed to identify common germline variants associated with EOC risk in Asian women. Genotyping was performed as part of the OncoArray project. Samples with >60% Asian ancestry were included in the analysis. Genotyping was performed on 533,631 SNPs in 3238 Asian subjects diagnosed with invasive or borderline EOC and 4083 unaffected controls. After imputation, genotypes were available for 11,595,112 SNPs to identify associations. At chromosome 6p25.2, SNP rs7748275 was associated with risk of serous EOC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, P = 8.7 × 10(-9)) and high-grade serous EOC (HGSOC) (OR = 1.34, P = 4.3 × 10(-9)). SNP rs6902488 at 6p25.2 (r(2) = 0.97 with rs7748275) lies in an active enhancer and is predicted to impact binding of STAT3, P300 and ELF1. We identified additional risk loci with low Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP) scores, indicating they are likely to be true risk associations (BFDP <10%). At chromosome 20q11.22, rs74272064 was associated with HGSOC risk (OR = 1.27, P = 9.0 × 10(-8)). Overall EOC risk was associated with rs10260419 at chromosome 7p21.3 (OR = 1.33, P = 1.2 × 10(-7)) and rs74917072 at chromosome 2q37.3 (OR = 1.25, P = 4.7 × 10(-7)). At 2q37.3, expression quantitative trait locus analysis in 404 HGSOC tissues identified ESPNL as a putative candidate susceptibility gene (P = 1.2 × 10(-7)). While some risk loci were shared between East Asian and European populations, others were population-specific, indicating that the landscape of EOC risk in Asian women has both shared and unique features compared to women of European ancestry.
30926877	Genome-wide association analysis suggests novel loci underlying thyroid antibodies in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.	Thyroid antibodies against thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are key markers of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), the most common autoimmune thyroid disorder. Genetic determinants of thyroid antibodies are still poorly known, especially as they were not studied in patients with thyroid diseases. We performed the first genome-wide association analysis of thyroid antibodies in 430 HT patients that may be considered as population extremes for thyroid antibodies distribution. We detected two suggestively associated genetic variants with TgAb, rs6972286 close to ANKRD7 and LSM8 (P = 2.34 × 10(-7)) and rs756763 inside CA10 (P = 6.05 × 10(-7)), and one with TPOAb, rs12507813 positioned between TRIM61 and TRIM60 (P = 4.95 × 10(-7)). Bivariate analysis resulted with three suggestively associated genetic variants that predispose to both antibodies: rs13190616 inside RP11-138J23.1 (P = 2.01 × 10(-6)), rs561030786 close to DUBR (P = 7.33 × 10(-6)) and rs12713034 inside FSHR (P = 7.66 × 10(-6)). All identified genomic regions have a substantial literature record of involvement with female-related traits, immune-mediated diseases and personality traits that are all characterized by increased thyroid antibody levels. Our findings demonstrate the existence of genetic overlap between thyroid autoimmunity in HT and different non-thyroid diseases characterized by the presence of thyroid antibodies. We also suggest that genetic variants that regulate antibody levels may differ between HT patients and individuals with normal thyroid function.
30941828	Common genetic variants have associations with human cortical brain regions and risk of schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia is a highly heritable mental disorder and is reported to be associated with measurements in cortical regions of the human brain. In this study, we considered genome-wide association studies to uncover genetic effects on cortical regions and prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. Specifically, area, thickness, and volume of 66 cortical regions derived from magnetic resonance imaging scans of 1,445 children and adolescents from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort were studied. Two common variants were identified as being associated with two prefrontal cortical regions (one significant variant rs11601331 on chromosome 11p11 for right rostral middle frontal gyral area, p = 1.97 × 10(-8) ; one suggestive variant rs2345981 on chromosome 6q11 for left frontal pole gyral volume, p = 2.07 × 10(-7) ), where the significance of rs11601331 was independently replicated on the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics study of size 1,239 (p = 9.19 × 10(-3) ). Moreover, genetic effects on schizophrenia were investigated based on a sample of 8,719 subjects. The two identified variants rs11601331 and rs2345981 showed significant association with the longest prodromal symptoms duration (p = 0.048 and p = 0.027, respectively).
30944420	Identification of a 1p21 independent functional variant for abdominal obesity.	Aiming to uncover the genetic basis of abdominal obesity, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of trunk fat mass adjusted by trunk lean mass (TFM(adj)) and followed by a series of functional investigations. A total of 11,569 subjects from six samples were included into the GWAS meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed by a weighted fixed-effects model. In silico replication analysis was performed in the UK-Biobank (UKB) sample (N = 331,093) and in the GIANT study (N up to 110,204). Cis-expression QTL (cis-eQTL) analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay and electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) were conducted to examine the functional relevance of the identified SNPs. At last, differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed. We identified an independent SNP rs12409479 at 1p21 (MAF = 0.07, p = 7.26 × 10(-10)), whose association was replicated by the analysis of TFM in the UKB sample (one-sided p = 3.39 × 10(-3)), and was cross-validated by the analyses of BMI (one-sided p = 0.03) and WHR(adj) (one-sided p = 0.04) in the GIANT study. Cis-eQTL analysis demonstrated that allele A at rs12409479 was positively associated with PTBP2 expression level in subcutaneous adipose tissue (N = 385, p = 4.15 × 10(-3)). Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that the region repressed PTBP2 gene expression by downregulating PTBP2 promoter activity (p < 0.001), and allele A at rs12409479 induced higher luciferase activity than allele G did (p = 4.15 × 10(-3)). EMSA experiment implied that allele A was more capable of binding to unknown transcription factors than allele G. Lastly, DGEA showed that the level of PTBP2 expression was higher in individuals with obesity than in individuals without obesity (N = 20 and 11, p = 0.04 and 9.22 × 10(-3)), suggesting a regulatory role in obesity development. Taken together, we hypothesize a regulating path from rs12409479 to trunk fat mass development through its allelic specific regulation of PTBP2 gene expression, thus providing some novel insight into the genetic basis of abdominal obesity.
30946743	Genome-wide association study in Turkish and Iranian populations identify rare familial Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) polymorphisms associated with ankylosing spondylitis.	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a highly heritable immune-mediated arthritis common in Turkish and Iranian populations. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease most common in people of Mediterranean origin. MEFV, an FMF-associated gene, is also a candidate gene for AS. We aimed to identify AS susceptibility loci and also examine the association between MEFV and AS in Turkish and Iranian cohorts. We performed genome-wide association studies in 1001 Turkish AS patients and 1011 Turkish controls, and 479 Iranian AS patients and 830 Iranian controls. Serum IL-1β, IL-17 and IL-23 cytokine levels were quantified in Turkish samples. An association of major effect was observed with a novel rare coding variant in MEFV in the Turkish cohort (rs61752717, M694V, OR = 5.3, P = 7.63×10(-12)), Iranian cohort (OR = 2.9, P = 0.042), and combined dataset (OR = 5.1, P = 1.65×10(-13)). 99.6% of Turkish AS cases, and 96% of those carrying MEFV rs61752717 variants, did not have FMF. In Turkish subjects, the association of rs61752717 was particularly strong in HLA-B27-negative cases (OR = 7.8, P = 8.93×10(-15)), but also positive in HLA-B27-positive cases (OR = 4.3, P = 7.69×10(-8)). Serum IL-1β, IL-17 and IL-23 levels were higher in AS cases than controls. Among AS cases, serum IL-1β and IL-23 levels were increased in MEFV 694V carriers compared with non-carriers. Our data suggest that FMF and AS have overlapping aetiopathogenic mechanisms. Functionally important MEFV mutations, such as M694V, lead to dysregulated inflammasome function and excessive IL-1β function. As IL-1 inhibition is effective in FMF, AS cases carrying FMF-associated MEFV variants may benefit from such therapy.
31006500	Protein and fat intake interacts with the haplotype of PTPN11_rs11066325, RPH3A_rs886477, and OAS3_rs2072134 to modulate serum HDL concentrations in middle-aged people.	Low serum HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and it is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We hypothesized that genetic variants that decrease serum HDL-C concentrations may interact with nutrient intakes in ways that increase or decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. Candidate genetic variants that can lower serum HDL-C concentrations were explored by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), after adjusting for covariates, in the Ansan/Ansung cohort (n = 8842) from KoGES. The best genetic variants were selected and used to form a haplotype. According to the haplotype frequencies of SNPs, they were divided into major allele, heterozygote allele, and minor allele. The association of haplotype with serum HDL-C levels was determined using logistic regression after adjusting for confounding factors. Interaction of the haplotype with nutrient intake was also determined. PTPN11_rs11066325, RPH3A_rs886477 and OAS3_rs2072134 were selected to modulate serum HDL-C levels from GWAS(P = 1.09E-09, 7.04E-10, and 1.27E-09, respectively). The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for a decrease in serum HDL-C concentration in the minor-allele group of the haplotype were elevated by 1.534 fold, compared to the major-allele group of the haplotype. Furthermore, the adjusted ORs for serum LDL cholesterol and levels increased by 1.645 in the minor-alleles compared to the major-alleles of the haplotype without a significant change of serum cholesterol levels. Interestingly, the adjusted ORs for serum triglyceride were lower in the minor-alleles than in the major-alleles. The haplotype had a significant interaction with the intake of protein, fat, saturated fatty acids (SAF) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; P < 0.05). In particular, the minor alleles of the haplotype decreased serum HDL-C levels compared to the major-alleles in the high intake of protein, fat, SFA, and PUFA, not in the low intake. People carrying the minor-allele of haplotypes should avoid diets that are high in protein and fat, especially rich in SFA and PUFA.
30952644	Clinical and Genome-wide Analysis of Cisplatin-induced Tinnitus Implicates Novel Ototoxic Mechanisms.	Cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic, results in tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound. Our purpose was to identify the clinical and genetic determinants of tinnitus among testicular cancer survivors (TCS) following cisplatin-based chemotherapy. TCS ((n) = 762) were dichotomized to cases (moderate/severe tinnitus;(n) = 154) and controls (none;(n) = 608). Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with comorbidities and SNP dosages in genome-wide association study (GWAS) following quality control and imputation (covariates: age, noise exposure, cisplatin dose, genetic principal components). Pathway over-representation tests and functional studies in mouse auditory cells were performed. Cisplatin-induced tinnitus (CisIT) significantly associated with age at diagnosis ((P) = 0.007) and cumulative cisplatin dose ((P) = 0.007). CisIT prevalence was not significantly greater in 400 mg/m(2)-treated TCS compared with 300 ((P) = 0.41), but doses >400 mg/m(2) (median 580, range 402-828) increased risk by 2.61-fold ((P) < 0.0001). CisIT cases had worse hearing at each frequency (0.25-12 kHz,(P) < 0.0001), and reported more vertigo (OR = 6.47;(P) < 0.0001) and problems hearing in a crowd (OR = 8.22;(P) < 0.0001) than controls. Cases reported poorer health ((P) < 0.0001) and greater psychotropic medication use (OR = 2.4;(P) = 0.003). GWAS suggested a variant near(OTOS) (rs7606353,(P) = 2 × 10(-6)) and(OTOS) eQTLs were significantly enriched independently of that SNP ((P) = 0.018).(OTOS) overexpression in HEI-OC1, a mouse auditory cell line, resulted in resistance to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Pathway analysis implicated potassium ion transport (q = 0.007). CisIT associated with several neuro-otological symptoms, increased use of psychotropic medication, and poorer health.(OTOS), expressed in the cochlear lateral wall, was implicated as protective. Future studies should investigate otoprotective targets in supporting cochlear cells.
30995994	Multivariate genome-wide association study of rapid automatised naming and rapid alternating stimulus in Hispanic American and African-American youth.	Rapid automatised naming (RAN) and rapid alternating stimulus (RAS) are reliable predictors of reading disability. The underlying biology of reading disability is poorly understood. However, the high correlation among RAN, RAS and reading could be attributable to shared genetic factors that contribute to common biological mechanisms. To identify shared genetic factors that contribute to RAN and RAS performance using a multivariate approach. We conducted a multivariate genome-wide association analysis of RAN Objects, RAN Letters and RAS Letters/Numbers in a sample of 1331 Hispanic American and African-American youth. Follow-up neuroimaging genetic analysis of cortical regions associated with reading ability in an independent sample and epigenetic examination of extant data predicting tissue-specific functionality in the brain were also conducted. Genome-wide significant effects were observed at rs1555839 (p=4.03×10(-8)) and replicated in an independent sample of 318 children of European ancestry. Epigenetic analysis and chromatin state models of the implicated 70 kb region of 10q23.31 support active transcription of the gene(RNLS) in the brain, which encodes a catecholamine metabolising protein. Chromatin contact maps of adult hippocampal tissue indicate a potential enhancer-promoter interaction regulating(RNLS) expression. Neuroimaging genetic analysis in an independent, multiethnic sample (n=690) showed that rs1555839 is associated with structural variation in the right inferior parietal lobule. This study provides support for a novel trait locus at chromosome 10q23.31 and proposes a potential gene-brain-behaviour relationship for targeted future functional analysis to understand underlying biological mechanisms for reading disability.
31020675	Integrative genome analysis identified the KANNO blood group antigen as prion protein.	Anti-KANNO, a broadly reactive RBC alloantibody, is found among some Japanese pregnant women, but the genetic basis of the corresponding antigen remains unclear. We integrated a statistical approach to identify the coding gene for KANNO antigen by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on four KANNO-negative individuals and 415 healthy Japanese. We also applied whole-exome sequencing to them and performed a replication study to confirm the identified genome variation using independent 14 KANNO-negative individuals. A monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of erythrocyte antigens (MAIEA) assay was used to locate KANNO antigen on RBC-specific membrane protein. In vivo and in vitro binding assays of anti-KANNO were further applied to the cells expressing a candidate protein. The GWAS revealed a genome-wide significant association of chromosome 20p13 locus (p = 2.76E-08; odds ratio > 1000 [95% confidence interval = 48-23,674]). The identified single-nucleotide polymorphism located in an intronic region of the prion protein (PRNP) gene. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a missense variant in the PRNP gene (rs1800014, E219K), which is in linkage disequilibrium with the single-nucleotide polymorphism identified in the GWAS. All 18 KANNO-negative individuals possessed the homozygous genotype of the missense variant. The MAIEA assay using anti-KANNO and mouse antihuman prion protein showed a clear difference between KANNO-positive and KANNO-negative RBCs. Anti-KANNO showed direct binding to CHO-K1 cells expressing wild-type PRNP but not to those expressing E219K PRNP. We first identified the coding gene of the high-frequency antigen KANNO located in PRNP and the missense variation (E219K) that affects the seropositivity of the KANNO antigen, which were confirmed by PRNP overexpressed cells.
31059154	Genome-wide survey of copy number variants finds MAPT duplications in progressive supranuclear palsy.	Progressive supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative tauopathy manifesting clinically as a progressive akinetic-rigid syndrome. In this study, we sought to identify genetic variants influencing PSP susceptibility through a genome-wide association analysis of a cohort of well-characterized patients who had participated in the Neuroprotection and Natural History in Parkinson Plus Syndromes and Blood Brain Barrier in Parkinson Plus Syndromes studies. We genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 283 PSP cases from the United Kingdom, Germany, and France and compared these with genotypes from 4472 controls. Copy number variants were identified from genotyping data. We observed associations on chromosome 17 within or close to the MAPT gene and explored the genetic architecture at this locus. We confirmed the previously reported association of rs1768208 in the MOBP gene (P = 3.29 × 10(-13) ) and rs1411478 in STX6 (P = 3.45 × 10(-10) ). The population-attributable risk from the MAPT, MOBP, and STX6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms was found to be 0.37, 0.26, and 0.08, respectively. In addition, we found 2 instances of copy number variants spanning the MAPT gene in patients with PSP. These copy number variants include tau but few other genes within the chromosome 17 haplotype region, providing additional support for the direct pathogenicity of MAPT in PSP. Clinicians should also be aware of MAPT duplication as a possible genetic cause of PSP, especially in patients presenting with young age at onset. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.
31081985	Genome-wide analyses of psychological resilience in U.S. Army soldiers.	Though a growing body of preclinical and translational research is illuminating a biological basis for resilience to stress, little is known about the genetic basis of psychological resilience in humans. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of self-assessed (by questionnaire) and outcome-based (incident mental disorders from predeployment to postdeployment) resilience among European (EUR) ancestry soldiers in the Army study to assess risk and resilience in servicemembers. Self-assessed resilience (N = 11,492) was found to have significant common-variant heritability (h(2) = 0.162, se = 0.050, p = 5.37 × 10(-4) ), and to be significantly negatively genetically correlated with neuroticism (r(g)  = -0.388, p = .0092). GWAS results from the EUR soldiers revealed a genome-wide significant locus on an intergenic region on Chr 4 upstream from doublecortin-like kinase 2 (DCLK2) (four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LD; top SNP: rs4260523 [p = 5.65 × 10(-9) ] is an eQTL in frontal cortex), a member of the doublecortin family of kinases that promote survival and regeneration of injured neurons. A second gene, kelch-like family member 36 (KLHL36) was detected at gene-wise genome-wide significance [p = 1.89 × 10(-6) ]. A polygenic risk score derived from the self-assessed resilience GWAS was not significantly associated with outcome-based resilience. In very preliminary results, genome-wide significant association with outcome-based resilience was found for one locus (top SNP: rs12580015 [p = 2.37 × 10(-8) ]) on Chr 12 downstream from solute carrier family 15 member 5 (SLC15A5) in subjects (N = 581) exposed to the highest level of deployment stress. The further study of genetic determinants of resilience has the potential to illuminate the molecular bases of stress-related psychopathology and point to new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
31089239	Genome-wide association study of right-sided colonic diverticulosis in a Korean population.	Diverticulosis results from complex interactions related to aging, environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Despite epidemiologic evidence of genetic risk factors, there has been no attempt to identify genes that confer susceptibility to colonic diverticulosis. We performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on susceptibility to diverticulosis in a Korean population. A GWAS was carried out in 7,948 healthy individuals: 893 patients and 1,075 controls comprised the test set, and 346 patients and 305 controls comprised the replication set. Diverticulosis was diagnosed by colonoscopy during comprehensive medical check-ups, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to diverticulosis were detected with the Affymetrix Axiom KORV1.1-96 Array. In all, 9 SNPs were identified in three SNP aggregates in the test set (P < 10(-3), within 200 kb) after adjusting for sex. All the SNPs were replicated in the replication set (P < 0.05). Three SNPs were near the WNT4 gene, four near the RHOU gene, and two in the OAS1/3 genes. The top SNP associated with right-sided colonic diverticulosis was rs22538787, located near the WNT4 gene [combined set, P-value = 3.128 × 10(-6), odds ratio = 1.415 (95% confidence interval: 1.223-1.637)]. These 9 novel SNP alleles associated with the WNT4, RHOU, and OAS1/3 genes are possibly involved in the underlying genetic susceptibility to right-sided diverticulosis. Our results provide basic knowledge about the development of diverticulosis in an Asian population.
31092297	Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci for type 2 diabetes-attributed end-stage kidney disease in African Americans.	End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a significant public health concern disproportionately affecting African Americans (AAs). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading cause of ESKD in the USA, and efforts to uncover genetic susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) have had limited success. A prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) in AAs with T2D-ESKD was expanded with additional AA cases and controls and genotypes imputed to the higher density 1000 Genomes reference panel. The discovery analysis included 3432 T2D-ESKD cases and 6977 non-diabetic non-nephropathy controls (N = 10,409), followed by a discrimination analysis in 2756 T2D non-nephropathy controls to exclude T2D-associated variants. Six independent variants located in or near RND3/RBM43, SLITRK3, ENPP7, GNG7, and APOL1 achieved genome-wide significant association (P < 5 × 10(-8)) with T2D-ESKD. Following extension analyses in 1910 non-diabetic ESKD cases and 908 non-diabetic non-nephropathy controls, a meta-analysis of 5342 AA all-cause ESKD cases and 6977 AA non-diabetic non-nephropathy controls revealed an additional novel all-cause ESKD locus at EFNB2 (rs77113398; P = 9.84 × 10(-9); OR = 1.94). Exclusion of APOL1 renal-risk genotype carriers identified two additional genome-wide significant T2D-ESKD-associated loci at GRAMD3 and MGAT4C. A second variant at GNG7 (rs373971520; P = 2.17 × 10(-8), OR = 1.46) remained associated with all-cause ESKD in the APOL1-negative analysis. Findings provide further evidence for genetic factors associated with advanced kidney disease in AAs with T2D.
31102405	A genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for primary central nervous system lymphoma at 6p25.3 and 3p22.1: a LOC network study.	Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of extra-nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma. PCNSL is a distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with over 95% of tumors belonging to the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) group. We have conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on immunocompetent patients to address the possibility that common genetic variants influence the risk of developing PCNSL. We performed a meta-analysis of two new genome-wide association studies of PCNSL totaling 475 cases and 1,134 controls of European ancestry. To increase genomic resolution, we imputed >10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the 1000 Genomes Project combined with UK10K as reference. In addition we performed a transcription factor binding disruption analysis and investigated the patterns of local chromatin patterns by capture Hi-C data. We identified independent risk loci at 3p22.1 (rs41289586, ANO10, P = 2.17 x 10-8) and 6p25.3 near EXOC2 (rs116446171, P = 1.95 x 10-13). In contrast the lack of an association between rs41289586 and DLBCL, suggests distinct germline predisposition to PCNSL and DLBCL. We found looping chromatin interactions between non-coding regions at 6p25.3 (rs11646171) with the IRF4 promoter and at 8q24.21 (rs13254990) with the MYC promoter, both genes with strong relevance to B-cell tumorigenesis. To our knowledge this is the first study providing insight into the genetic predisposition to PCNSL. Our findings represent an important step in defining the contribution of common genetic variation to the risk of developing PCNSL.
31109976	Genomewide Association Study Confirming the Association of 	Antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI) is a common side effect leading to tuberculosis (TB) treatment disruption. The mechanism of the disease remains poorly understood. We conducted a genomewide association study (GWAS) to investigate all possible genetic factors of ATDILI in Thai patients. This study was carried out in Thai TB patients, including 79 ATDILI cases and 239 tolerant controls from our network hospitals in Thailand. Nearly 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped across the whole genome using an Illumina OmniExpress Exome BeadChip array. In the discovery stage, we identified strong association signals on chromosome 8 originating from the(N)-acetyltransferase ((NAT2)) region. The A allele of rs1495741, the top SNP in the intergenic region of(NAT2) and(PSD3) (14 kb from(NAT2)), was significantly associated with ATDILI (recessive model, odds ratio of 6.01 [95% confidence interval, 3.42 to 10.57];(P) = 6.86E-11). This particular SNP was reported as a tag SNP for(NAT2) inferred phenotypes. The AA, AG, and GG genotypes represented(NAT2) slow acetylators, intermediate acetylators, and fast acetylators, respectively. The tag SNP genotypes demonstrated a concordance rate of 94.98% with(NAT2) acetylator phenotypes. This GWAS shows that(NAT2) is the most important risk factor for ATDILI in the Thai population.
30003307	Genome-wide association study of coronary artery disease among individuals with diabetes: the UK Biobank.	Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common complication among individuals with diabetes. A better understanding of the genetic background of CAD in this population has the potential to suggest novel molecular targets for screening, risk assessment and drug development. We performed a genome-wide association study of CAD in 15,666 unrelated individuals (3,968 CAD cases and 11,698 controls) of white British ancestry with diabetes at inclusion in the UK Biobank study. Our results were compared with results from participants without diabetes. We found genome-wide significant evidence for association with CAD at the previously well-established LPA locus (lead variant: rs74617384; OR 1.38 [95% CI 1.26, 1.51], p = 3.2 × 10(-12)) and at 9p21 (lead variant: rs10811652; OR 1.19 [95% CI 1.13, 1.26], p = 6.0 × 10(-11)). Moreover, other variants previously associated with CAD showed similar effects in the participants with and without diabetes, indicating that the genetic architecture of CAD is largely the same. Our results indicate large similarities between the genetic architecture of CAD in participants with and without diabetes. Larger studies are needed to establish whether there are important diabetes-specific CAD loci.
